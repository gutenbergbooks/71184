<div class="blockquot">
<p>In the present edition of this work a few new subjects have been added
and the text has been somewhat altered in order that certain recent
advances and changes might be noted and brought into daily service.
I have not been unmindful, however, of the fact that to be of the
greatest possible use to our profession this volume must remain small
and compact.</p>

<p>I hear frequently that this Handbook is valued by my fellow-workers and
that it is to many of them a daily help and companion. This is a source
of great pleasure to me, and I hope that this new edition will be found
more useful even than any of its predecessors.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>As a probationer doing class and hospital work and as a graduate
trained nurse I took notes of all the various formul√¶, directions,
etc., that might at some time be useful to me in the pursuit of
my duties. My class work was productive of many valuable items of
information; these and such other items as I gathered in the course of
my hospital work and while on private duty, and others which were the
result of my own experience and observation, I kept in a memorandum
book which soon became indispensable to me, and which I used until the
leaves became worn and fell apart. I rewrote this memorandum book three
times, and the task of its fourth rewriting made me wish that I had its
contents in a form more easily preserved. The inspiration followed that
my notes in book form would be of general use to most nurses and of
some use to many physicians. This little volume is the result.</p>

<p>To my own notes, all of which have been submitted to competent
authorities for criticism, I have added several articles by eminent
physicians and superintending nurses, which tend to round out the
usefulness of the book. I have kept in mind, however, my original
intention of producing a hand-book of convenient size for quick
reference.</p>

<p>To the authors of these articles, to the friendly critics to whom my
notes were submitted, and to the kind friends who encouraged me in this
work, I extend my sincere thanks.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ACTION, USES, AND DOSES OF<br> THE MOST IMPORTANT DRUGS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Acetanilid.</b>‚ÄîThis substance, a
derivative of anilin, is used to lower temperature; to relieve
headaches and neuralgic pains; and to allay spasm, as in chorea and
whooping-cough.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Toxic doses cause lividity, cold sweats, ringing
in the ears, and heart failure.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> is from 5 to 10 grains (0.3-0.6 gm.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Arsenic.</b>‚ÄîArsenic is used internally as a
tonic in anemia, an alterative in chronic constitutional diseases, as
a special remedy in chorea, and as an anti-malarial. Externally, it is
occasionally used as a caustic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The indications of its too free use are puffiness under the eyes, or
griping pains in the abdomen, with diarrhea.</p>

<p>Toxic doses cause abdominal pain, vomiting, purging, swelling of the
face, and collapse.</p>

<p>Preparations of arsenic should be given after meals. The <i>dose</i>
of <i>arsenous acid</i> is from ¬π/‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ to ¬π/‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ grain (0.0016-0.0032 gm.);
of <i>Fowler‚Äôs Solution</i> (Liquor Potassii Arsenitis), 1 minim (0.06
c.c.), very gradually increased to 10 minims (0.6 c.c.).</p>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Aconite.</b>‚ÄîThis drug depresses the heart,
slows the pulse, and lowers temperature. Externally, it causes numbness
and anesthesia. Internally, it is employed chiefly as a heart sedative
in hypertrophy of the heart, and as a febrifuge in acute febrile
disease when the pulse is strong and rapid. Locally, it is sometimes
employed in liniments in neuralgia and muscular rheumatism.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Aconite is a powerful poison, causing in overdoses
tingling of the lips, tongue, and extremities, cold sweat, pallor, a
feeble pulse, and collapse.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of the <i>tincture</i> (Tinctura
Aconiti) is from 1 to 5 minims (0.06-0.3 c.c.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Alcohol.</b>‚ÄîIn moderate cases alcohol
stimulates the heart, favors digestion, and lessens tissue-waste. For
these reasons it is a useful remedy in low fevers, like typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and pneumonia. On account of its prompt action, it is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
valuable circulatory stimulant in sudden heart failure. It has been
recently recommended also as an antidote in carbolic-acid poisoning.
Externally, it is used as a cleanser for the skin and as a stimulant
application in the prevention of bed-sores.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Preparations.</i>‚Äî<i>Wines</i> are produced by the spontaneous
fermentation of fruits. The strongest are port, Madeira, and sherry,
each of which contains about 20 per cent. of alcohol. The <i>dose</i>
is from 4 to 8 drams (15-30 c.c.). The weakest wines are the clarets
and Rhine wines, which contain about 8 per cent. of alcohol. The
<i>dose</i> of these is from 1 to 2 ounces (30-60 c.c.).</p>

<p><i>Champagne</i> is prepared by adding sugar to an ordinary wine,
and allowing the mixture to ferment in corked bottles, the carbon
dioxid thus being retained. It contains from 10 to 12 per cent. of
alcohol. The <i>dose</i> is from 1 to 2 ounces (30-60 c.c.).</p>

<p><i>Whisky</i> is made by subjecting fermented grains to
distillation. <i>Rum</i> is made by distilling fermented molasses.
<i>Gin</i> is prepared by distilling fermented grain and adding oil of
juniper berries to the distillate.</p>

<p><i>Brandy</i> is a spirit produced by the distillation of a wine.</p>

<p>Whisky, rum, gin, and brandy contain from 40 to 50 per cent. of
alcohol. The <i>dose</i> of each is from 1 to 4 drams (4-15 c.c.).</p>

<p><i>Beer</i>, <i>ale</i>, and <i>porter</i> are made from an infusion
of malt‚Äîthat is, fermented barley, flavored with hops. They each
contain from 4 to 6 per cent. of alcohol.</p>

<p>In large doses alcohol in any form causes mental excitement,
delirium, loss of co-ordination, and finally stupor and coma. Death may
result from paralysis of the heart or respiration.</p>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Aloes.</b>‚ÄîThis is cathartic and stimulant,
and is given in chronic constipation, amenorrhea, and atonic dyspepsia.
The laxative <i>dose</i> is from ¬Ω to 2 grains; the purgative and
emmenagogue <i>dose</i> is 2 to 5 grains.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Ammonia.</b>‚ÄîThis is a gas employed
medicinally in the form of a watery solution (water of ammonia) or an
alcoholic solution (spirit of ammonia).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">These preparations are used internally as heart
stimulants, respiratory stimulants, gastric antacids, and externally
as counterirritants. The <i>dose</i> of the <i>Aromatic Spirit</i>
(Spiritus Ammoni√¶ Aromaticus) is from ¬Ω to 1 dram (2-4 c.c.), well
diluted. Large doses of ammonia preparations cause burning pain in the
throat and abdomen, vomiting, purging, and collapse.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Antipyrin.</b>‚ÄîThis drug has about the
same action and uses as acetanilid, and may be given in the same
<i>dose</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Antitoxin of Diphtheria.</b>‚ÄîThis is obtained
from healthy horses which have been rendered artificially immune to
diphtheria from having received a prolonged course of treatment with
diphtheria toxin in doses gradually increased. The immunity is due to
the formation in the blood of a substance which in some way counteracts
the poison or toxin of the disease. This substance is known as the
antitoxin. It exists in the serum of the blood, and so far has not been
separated from it. The dose of the serum is measured in units, a unit
being ten times the amount of antitoxin required to save the life of a
guinea-pig which has been injected with 100 fatal doses of diphtheria
toxin.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Antitoxin acts both as a curative and a preventive
remedy. Since its introduction the mortality of diphtheria has been
reduced more than one-half. The <i>curative</i> <i>dose</i> is from
2000 to 5000 units, to be repeated in from six to twelve hours, if
necessary. The <i>prophylactic dose</i> is 500 units. The protection
afforded is only temporary, lasting from two to three weeks.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The injections are sometimes followed by a rise
of temperature, pain in the joints, or a cutaneous rash, but these
symptoms are without serious significance.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Aspirin.</b>‚ÄîThis is acetyl-salicylic acid and
is used like sodium salicylate in rheumatism and pleurisy, and as an
antipyretic and analgesic. <i>Dose</i>, 5 to 15 grains.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Atropin.</b>‚ÄîSee <i>Belladonna</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Belladonna.</b>‚ÄîThis drug owes its
activity to the alkaloid <i>atropin</i>. It is employed internally to
stimulate the respiration; to stimulate the circulation; to allay local
spasm, as in asthma and whooping-cough; to check excessive secretion,
as in the night-sweats of phthisis; and to stimulate peristalsis in
atonic constipation. Locally, it is employed in the form of solutions
of atropin to dilate the pupil of the eye, and in the form of a
liniment or plaster of belladonna as a sedative application in various
inflammatory conditions. Toxic doses of belladonna cause dilatation
of the pupils, dryness of the throat, quickening of the pulse and
respiration, delirium, and a diffuse red rash resembling that of
scarlatina.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of <i>atropin</i> is from
¬π/‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ to ¬π/‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ grain (0.00043-0.0013 gm.); of the <i>Tincture of</i>
<i>Belladonna</i> (Tinctura Belladonn√¶), 5 to 20 minims (0.3-1.2 c.c.);
of the <i>Extract of Belladonna</i> (Extractum Belladonn√¶), ‚Öõ to ¬º
grain (0.008-0.016 gm.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Bismuth.</b>‚ÄîThe insoluble preparations of the
metal‚Äî<i>subnitrate</i>, <i>subcarbonate</i>, and <i>subgallate</i>‚Äîare
used internally as mild antiseptics, sedatives, astringents, and
antacids in various inflammatory diseases of the stomach and bowel.
They are scarcely poisonous when taken internally in any amount. The
usual <i>dose</i> of any one of the preparations named is from 5 to 30
grains (0.3-2 gm.) in dry powder or stirred in milk or water.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Bromids.</b>‚ÄîThe salts of bromin in common
use are the bromids of potassium, sodium, ammonium, and strontium.
The action of these is very similar. They are especially useful as
depressants to the central nervous system. They are employed to produce
sleep, to check convulsions, and to relieve headache and neuralgic
pain. Large doses depress the heart and respiration. The continued use
of the bromids causes a condition known as <i>bromism</i>. This is
characterized by fetor of the breath, a rash on the skin, languor, and
somnolence. The <i>dose</i> of the <i>bromin salts</i> is from 10 to 60
grains (0.6-4 gm.).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Caffein.</b>‚ÄîThis is an alkaloid obtained
from coffee. It is a heart stimulant, respiratory stimulant, brain
stimulant, and kidney stimulant (diuretic). The <i>dose</i> is from 1
to 5 grains (0.06-0.3 gm.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Calomel.</b>‚ÄîSee <i>Mercury</i>.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Carbolic Acid.</b>‚ÄîExternally, this acid is
used in weak solutions (1 : 40 to 1 : 20) as an antiseptic, and in
concentrated form as a caustic. Weak solutions are also employed to
allay itching in skin diseases. Internally, carbolic acid is used as an
antiseptic in dyspepsia and diarrhea. Applications of carbolic acid,
even when dilute, should never be prolonged, as they are liable to
cause gangrene. Poisoning by carbolic acid is characterized by white
patches on the lips, the odor of the drug on the breath, burning pain
in the abdomen, vomiting, purging, unconsciousness, and collapse. The
<i>dose</i> is from ¬Ω to 3 minims (0.03-0.2 c.c.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Castor Oil.</b>‚ÄîThis is an oil expressed
from the seed of an East Indian plant. The seeds themselves are acrid
poisons. It is a mild purgative, unloading the bowels very thoroughly
in from four to six hours. It may be given in flexible capsules,
in emulsion, or with equal parts of lemon-juice and glycerin. The
<i>dose</i> is from ¬Ω to 1 ounce (15-30 c.c.).</p>

<p class="blockquot">There are two simple methods of taking castor
oil without producing nauseating effects. Have the patient wash out
the mouth with water as hot as can be borne, then swallow the oil,
and follow this by rinsing out the mouth well with hot water. The
other method is to hold a piece of ice in the mouth long enough to
chill the lining membrane, swallow the oil, and rinse the mouth with
ice-water.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Chloral.</b>‚ÄîThis substance is an active
depressant of the brain and spinal cord. In large doses it also
depresses the heart and respiration. It is employed to produce sleep
and to check convulsions. The <i>dose</i> is from 10 to 30 grains
(0.6-2 gm.) in some agreeable syrup.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Poisonous doses cause unconsciousness, embarrassed
breathing, and collapse.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Chloralamid.</b>‚ÄîThis is a comparatively safe
and reliable hypnotic, producing sleep without causing much depression
of the heart or disagreeable after-effects. The <i>dose</i> is from 10
to 30 grains (0.6-2 gm.), well diluted. Hot liquids decompose it.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Chloroform.</b>‚ÄîThis substance is employed
by inhalation as a general anesthetic, by the mouth as a sedative in
colic, neuralgia of the stomach, and obstinate cough, and externally
in the form of liniment as a counterirritant in muscular rheumatism,
sprains, etc. As a general anesthetic it is more powerful than ether,
more readily inhaled, but not so safe. Death from chloroform is
usually the result of heart failure. The <i>dose</i> of <i>Spirit of
Chloroform</i> (Spiritus Chloroformi) is from 5 to 30 minims (0.3-2
c.c.); of <i>Chloroform-water</i> (Aqua Chloroformi), 1 to 8 drams
(4-30 c.c.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Cinchona (Peruvian Bark).</b>‚ÄîThis is the bark
of an evergreen tree growing in the tropics. It owes its medicinal
properties to <i>quinin</i> and <i>cinchonin</i>, especially the
former. It is used as a general tonic, as a stomachic, as a febrifuge,
and as an anti-malarial. Large doses cause ringing in the ears,
headache, deafness, dimness of vision, convulsions, and coma. The
<i>dose</i> of <i>quinin</i> and its salts is from 1 to 30 grains
(0.06-2 gm.); of <i>cinchonin</i>, 1 to 30 grains (0.06-2 gm.); of the
<i>Compound Tincture</i> <i>of Cinchona</i> (Huxham‚Äôs Tincture), 1 to 4
drams (4-15 c.c.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Cocain.</b>‚ÄîThis is the alkaloid of a shrub
(<i>coca</i>) growing in South America. Applied to mucous membranes
or raw surfaces, or injected under the skin, it blanches the part
and produces anesthesia. Applied directly to the skin, however, it
is without effect, as it is not absorbed from the unbroken skin.
Internally, it is sometimes employed to stimulate the heart, to
stimulate the respiration, and to allay vomiting. Its repeated use,
even as a local remedy, is dangerous, in that it is prone to cause a
habit, the symptoms of which are mental failure, loss of flesh and
strength, anemia, and intense craving for the drug. The symptoms of
acute cocain-poisoning are excitement, delirium, a rapid pulse, hurried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
breathing, convulsions, and coma. The <i>dose</i> of <i>cocain</i> is
from ‚Öõ to ¬Ω grain (0.008-0.03 gm.). As an anesthetic it is usually
employed in from 2 to 4 per cent. solutions.</p>

<p class="blockquot">A 2¬Ω-grain tablet of cocain, dissolved in a
teaspoonful of water, makes a 2 per cent. solution; a 4¬Ω-grain tablet,
in the same amount of water makes a 4 per cent. solution; a 10¬Ω-grain
tablet in a like amount furnishes a 10 per cent. solution. These
percentages are not mathematically correct, but are sufficiently exact
for any surgical purposes.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Cod-liver Oil.</b>‚ÄîThis is more of a food
than a medicine. It is preferable to other oils in being more readily
digested. When well borne by the stomach, it is a valuable remedy in
wasting diseases, especially phthisis. The <i>dose</i> is from 1 to 4
drams (4-15 c.c.). It may be given in emulsion, in flexible capsules,
or pure, dropped in the froth of porter. It is best taken two hours
after meals.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Creasote.</b>‚ÄîThis is an oily substance
obtained from the slow burning of beechwood. It is chiefly used
internally as an antiseptic in dyspepsia and diarrhea, and as an
expectorant in purulent bronchitis and phthisis. Large doses produce
the same toxic effects as are observed in carbolic-acid poisoning.
The <i>dose</i> is from 2 to 20 minims (0.1-1.2 c.c.) in capsules, in
milk, or in some bitter tincture, like that of gentian. The <i>dose</i>
of <i>creasote carbonate</i> (creosotal), which is free from the
unpleasant odor and taste of pure creasote, is from 5 to 20 minims
(0.3-1.2 c.c.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Croton Oil (Oleum Tiglii).</b>‚ÄîThis is an
oil expressed from the seed of a small tree growing in Asia. Locally
it is an active vesicant; internally it is a powerful purgative.
Large doses cause severe inflammation of the stomach and bowels. The
<i>dose</i> is from 1 to 2 drops (0.06-0.12 c.c.) in glycerin, olive
oil, or bread-crumbs. A bland vehicle is necessary to prevent the
vesicating effect of the drug on the throat. Diluted with from 2 to 4
parts of olive oil, and applied with friction, it is sometimes used as
a counterirritant in inflammatory diseases of the chest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Digitalis.</b>‚ÄîThis is a powerful
circulatory stimulant, strengthening the contractions of the heart,
constricting the peripheral blood-vessels, and slowing the pulse. By
increasing the blood-pressure in the kidneys it also increases the
flow of urine. It is chiefly used as a stimulant in heart disease when
there is failure of circulation, and as a diuretic in various forms
of dropsy. The effects of the drug should be carefully watched; too
large doses cause marked slowing and irregularity of the pulse, and
a decrease rather than an increase in the urine. The <i>dose</i> of
<i>powdered digitalis leaves</i> is from ¬Ω to 2 grains (0.03-0.13 gm.);
of the <i>Tincture</i> (Tinctura Digitalis), 5 to 20 minims (0.3-1.2
c.c.); of the <i>infusion</i> (infusum digitalis), 1 to 4 drams (4-15
c.c.); of <i>digitalin</i>, an important principle of the leaves, ¬π/‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ
to ¬π/‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ grain (0.00065-0.001 gm.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Ergot.</b>‚ÄîThis is a fungus growing
on rye. It is employed to contract the blood-vessels in internal
hemorrhage and to stimulate the uterine contractions in the second
stage of labor when post-partum hemorrhage is feared. Its use in the
early stage of labor to hasten delivery is dangerous, since it may
cause tetanic spasm of the uterus and asphyxiation of the child or even
rupture of the uterus.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of the <i>Extract of Ergot</i>
(Extractum Ergot√¶) is from 1 to 15 grains (0.065-1 gm.); of the
<i>Fluid Extract</i> (Extractum Ergot√¶ Fluidum), ¬Ω to 1 dram (2-4
c.c.); of the <i>Wine</i> (Vinum Ergot√¶), 1 to 4 drams (4-15 c.c.); of
<i>ergotin</i>, a concentrated extract, 2 to 5 grains (0.13-0.3 gm.).
When given hypodermically abscess is likely to form, even under the
most strict antiseptic precautions.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Ether.</b>‚ÄîNext to nitrous oxid, this
is the safest of the general anesthetics, although it is not so
readily inhaled as chloroform, and is more apt to produce unpleasant
after-effects, such as nausea and vomiting. The latter may sometimes
be relieved by the inhalation of hot vinegar fumes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Death from ether is usually the result of
asphyxia, and not, as in the case of chloroform, from heart failure.
Internally, by the mouth or hypodermically, ether is sometimes used as
a circulatory stimulant in sudden heart failure. Great care should be
exercised in handling ether in the neighborhood of lighted gas-jets,
as the vapor of the drug is highly inflammable. Ether should be stored
in well-stoppered containers, in a cool place, remote from lights and
fire.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of ether as a circulatory
stimulant is from 5 to 30 minims (0.3-2 c.c.) in ice-water or
hypodermically.</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Formaldehyd.</b>‚ÄîThis gas is employed
in the form of a 40 per cent. solution (<i>formalin</i>). It is
used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and deodorant. It is the best
disinfectant for sick-rooms that we possess, although on account of its
lack of penetrating power it can not be used for disinfecting bedding,
stuffed furniture, carpets, books, etc. To be effective the gas must
be generated from formalin in a special apparatus, or from paraform
tablets heated over a suitable lamp. Attempts to vaporize solution of
formaldehyd from an open vessel placed on a stove are unsuccessful,
since this treatment converts most of the formaldehyd gas into crystals
of paraform. Solutions of formalin‚Äî1 : 2000 to 1 : 500‚Äîare sometimes
used for irrigating suppurating cavities and disinfecting instruments.
A solution of 1 part of formalin to 20 parts of water makes a good
disinfectant for stools, urine, and sputa.</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Iodids.</b>‚ÄîThe salts of iodin‚Äîpotassium,
sodium, ammonium iodid‚Äîresemble each other in their action and uses.
They are used as alteratives in constitutional diseases, like chronic
rheumatism and gout, as absorbents of exudates in chronic inflammatory
diseases, and as eliminants in chronic mineral poisoning. Their
continued use occasions a group of symptoms‚Äîfrontal headache, nasal
discharge, sore throat, and a cutaneous eruption‚Äîtermed <i>iodism</i>. The
<i>dose</i> is from 5 to 30 grains (0.3-2 gm.), well diluted, after meals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Iodoform.</b>‚ÄîThis drug owes its virtues
to iodin, of which it contains about 50 per cent. When brought into
contact with raw surfaces it exerts a mild anesthetic effect, liberates
its iodin, and thereby acts as an antiseptic. When applied too freely
it may be absorbed and cause toxic effects‚Äîheadache, elevation of
temperature, restlessness, a diffuse red rash on the face and limbs,
delirium, stupor, and collapse. The unpleasant odor of the drug can be
removed from the hands and from instruments by oil of turpentine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Ipecac.</b>‚ÄîThis drug is used as an emetic and
expectorant. As an emetic it is safe, but somewhat slow in action. It
is especially useful in the young and feeble, as it causes but little
depression.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of powdered ipecac, as an emetic,
is from 20 to 30 grains (1.2-2 gm.); of the <i>Syrup</i> (Syrupus
Ipecacuanh√¶), as an expectorant, from 10-60 minims (0.6-4 c.c.); as an
emetic, from 2 to 4 drams (8-15 c.c.); of the wine, as an expectorant,
from 10 to 30 minims (0.6-1.8 c.c.); as an emetic, 1 dram (4 c.c.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Iron. (Ferrum).</b>‚ÄîThe various preparations
of iron are employed as tonics and astringents. As tonics, they are
especially indicated in simple anemia; as astringents they are employed
locally in bleeding, and, internally, in diarrhea.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of <i>Reduced Iron</i> (Ferrum
Reductum) is from 1 to 5 grains (0.06-0.3 gm.); of the <i>Pills</i>
<i>of Iron Carbonate</i> or <i>Blaud‚Äôs Pills</i> (Pilul√¶ Ferri
Carbonatis), 1 to 3 pills; of the <i>Tincture</i> <i>of Ferric
Chlorid</i> (Tinctura Ferri Chloridi), 5 to 10 minims (0.3-0.6
c.c.); of the <i>Solution of Iron</i> <i>and Ammonium Acetate</i> or
<i>Basham‚Äôs Mixture</i> (Liquor Ferri et Ammonii Acetatis), 1 to 4
drams (4-15 c.c.); of the <i>Sulphate of Iron</i> (Ferri Sulphas), 1-3
grains (0.06-0.2 gm.); of the Syrup of <i>Iodid of</i> <i>Iron</i>
(Syrupus Ferri Iodidi), 5 to 60 minims (0.3-4 c.c.). The <i>Solution
of Iron Subsulphate</i> (Monsel‚Äôs solution) is used only as a
hemostatic, and <i>Iron Hydrate with Magnesia</i> as an antidote in
arsenic-poisoning. The <i>dose</i> of the latter is a tablespoonful
every ten to fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Lead.</b>‚ÄîThe preparations of lead
are used internally and externally as sedatives and astringents.
<i>Lead</i> <i>Acetate</i> (Plumbi Acetas) is employed internally in
diarrhea. The <i>dose</i> is from 1 to 3 grains (0.06-0.2 gm.), in pill form.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The <i>Solution</i> of <i>Lead Subacetate</i> (Liquor Plumbi
Subacetatis) is employed externally. Diluted with from 5 to 6 parts
of water it is used as a sedative application in ivy-poisoning and
erysipelas.</p>

<p>The <i>Dilute Solution</i> of <i>Lead Subacetate</i> (Liquor Plumbi
Subacetatis Dilutus) is known as <i>lead-water</i>, and is chiefly
employed in making the sedative preparation known as lead-water and
laudanum. As usually dispensed it contains 1 dram (4 c.c.) of laudanum
and 4 drams (15 c.c.) of lead-water to 2 ounces (60 c.c.) of water.</p>

<p><i>Acute lead-poisoning</i> is characterized by a burning pain in
the abdomen, a metallic taste in the mouth, vomiting, purging, coma,
and collapse.</p>

<p><i>Chronic lead-poisoning</i> is characterized by anemia, intestinal
colic, constipation, a blue line on the gums (deposit of lead
sulphide), and paralysis of the forearms (wrist-drop).</p>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Magnesium Sulphate (Epsom Salt).</b>‚ÄîThis salt is
an excellent hydragogue cathartic, producing in the
course of a few hours copious watery stools. It is also
employed as an antidote in acute lead-poisoning and
carbolic-acid poisoning.</p>

<p class="blockquot">To secure the most prompt and powerful cathartic effect
the drug is best given before breakfast, in a single dose,
and with but a small quantity of water. <i>Dose</i>,
from 1 to 8 drams (4-31 gm.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Magnesium Oxid (Magnesia).</b>‚ÄîThis is a
white, tasteless, and insoluble powder. It is a cathartic, but much
milder in action than Epsom salt. <i>Dose</i>, from 10 to 60 grains
(0.6-4 gm.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Magnesium Citrate.</b>‚ÄîAn effervescing
solution of this drug is much used as an agreeable laxative. The
<i>dose</i> is from 6 to 12 ounces (180-360 c.c.).</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Mercury.</b>‚ÄîThe most important preparations
of this metal are calomel, blue mass, corrosive sublimate, oxid of
mercury, iodid of mercury, nitrate of mercury, and ointment of mercury.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Calomel</i> (Hydrargyri Chloridi Mite).‚ÄîThis preparation is
employed internally as a cathartic and gastric sedative, and externally
as a stimulating and antiseptic dusting-powder. As a cathartic its best
effect is secured by giving it in <i>doses</i> of from ‚Öí to ‚Öô grain
(0.006-0.01 gm.) every half-hour or hour, until a grain has been taken.
In this way the whole amount ingested is absorbed. When large doses are
employed much of the drug escapes absorption.</p>

<p><i>Blue Mass</i> or <i>Blue Pill</i> (Massa Hydrargyri).‚ÄîThis is a
mixture of mercury, glycerin, honey, and licorice. Its action is much
like that of calomel.</p>

<p><i>Corrosive Sublimate</i> or <i>Bichlorid of Mercury</i>
(Hydrargyri Chloridum Corrosivum).‚ÄîAlthough irritant, toxic, and
destructive to instruments, no other drug has supplanted this salt
as an antiseptic for use in general surgery. The following are the
strengths of the solutions usually employed for various purposes: for
the skin, 1 : 1000 to 1 : 500; for wounds, 1 : 10,000 to 1 : 2000;
for cavities of the body, 1 : 20,000 to 1 : 5000. Corrosive sublimate
is not a good disinfectant for stools, sputa, etc., as it forms an
impenetrable coagulum on the outside of the mass. Internally, corrosive
sublimate is used as an alterative in constitutional diseases in
<i>doses</i> of ¬π/‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ to ¬π/‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ of a grain (0.001-0.005 gm.).</p>

<p><i>Oxid of Mercury.</i>‚ÄîThis appears in two forms‚Äîyellow oxid and
red oxid. Both preparations are employed externally in the form of
ointments for their alterative properties.</p>

<p><i>Iodid of Mercury.</i>‚ÄîThis salt occurs in two forms: Red Iodid
or Biniodid (Hydrargyri Iodidum Rubrum) and Yellow or Green Iodid
(Hydrargyri Iodidum Flavum). The first is an irritating preparation,
somewhat resembling corrosive sublimate in its action; the latter
is comparatively unirritating, and is much used internally as an
alterative. The <i>dose</i> of the <i>red iodid</i> is from ¬π/‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ
to ¬π/‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ grain (0.001-0.005 gm.); of the <i>yellow</i> or <i>green
iodid</i>, ¬π/‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ to ¬Ω grain (0.006-0.03 gm.).</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of Mercury.</i>‚ÄîThis preparation is used in the form of
a solution (Liquor Hydrargyri Nitratis) as a powerful caustic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p><i>Ointment of Mercury</i>, or <i>Blue Ointment</i> (Unguentum
Hydrargyri).‚ÄîThis is an ointment of metallic mercury. It is used as a
stimulant and absorbent application in chronic inflammatory swellings,
as a parasiticide in certain skin diseases, and by inunction in
syphilis. When used for the latter purpose about a dram (4 gm.) should
be rubbed in the axilla, groin, or inner surface of the arm or thigh
daily, a different region being selected each time, so as to avoid
irritation of the skin.</p>

<p><i>Mercurial Poisoning.</i>‚ÄîPatients taking mercury continuously,
even in small doses, should be carefully watched, as symptoms of
<i>ptyalism</i> or <i>salivation</i> sometimes arise very speedily.
This condition is manifested by fetor of the breath, soreness of the
teeth when the jaws are brought together, increased flow of saliva,
redness and swelling of the gums, and finally by ulceration of the
tissues, loss of the teeth, and necrosis of the jaw bones. On the
slightest evidence of these symptoms the drug should be suspended, and
the mouth washed out frequently with a solution of hydrogen peroxid (1
: 4) or of potassium chlorate (1 dram to 8 ounces of water).</p>

<p>The ingestion of a single large <i>dose</i> of an irritant salt
of mercury, such as the bichlorid or biniodid, gives rise to severe
burning pain in the abdomen, vomiting, bloody purging, and collapse.</p>
</div>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Nitroglycerin.</b>‚ÄîThis drug is a
depressant to the central nervous system, a heart stimulant, and a
dilator of the peripheral blood-vessels. It is useful in certain local
spasms (asthma), in heart failure, and in neuralgia of the heart. Owing
to its action in dilating the vessels, it sometimes causes, even in
small doses, headache, dizziness, and flushing of the face.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of nitroglycerin is from ¬π/‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ to
¬π/‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ of a grain (0.0003-0.0013 gm.). The <i>dose</i> of the 1 per cent.
alcoholic solution (Spiritus Glonoini) is from 1 to 5 minims (0.06-0.3
c.c.). The latter should be kept in well-stoppered bottles, in a cool
place, remote from lights or fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Nux Vomica.</b>‚ÄîThis is the seed of an East
Indian tree. Its activity depends upon an alkaloid <i>strychnin</i>.
It is a general stimulant, acting especially upon the spinal cord,
respiratory center, heart, stomach, and intestine. It is employed in
a great variety of affections in which there is deficient functional
activity.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The limit of tolerance is indicated by
restlessness, stiffness of the neck muscles, and jerking of the limbs.
Toxic doses cause violent spasms closely resembling those of lock-jaw
or tetanus. The convulsions of strychnin-poisoning, however, come
and go, the muscles being completely relaxed in the intervals, and,
moreover, they rarely involve the muscles of the jaw.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of the <i>Tincture of Nux
Vomica</i> (Tinctura Nucis Vomic√¶) is from 5 to 20 minims (0.3-1.2
c.c.); of the <i>Extract of Nux Vomica</i> (Extractum Nucis Vomic√¶), ‚Öô

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Opium.</b>‚ÄîThis is the dried juice of a
species of poppy growing in Asia. It contains several alkaloids, the
chief of which are <i>morphin</i> and <i>codein</i>. From morphin are
prepared artificially two alkaloids‚Äî<i>apomorphin</i> and <i>heroin</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"> <p>Opium depresses the brain, depresses the
respiration, stimulates the heart slightly, lessens the peristaltic
movements of the bowel, and diminishes all secretions, except the
sweat. It is employed to induce sleep, to relieve pain, to allay cough,
to check diarrhea, and to promote perspiration.</p>

<p><i>Opium-poisoning</i> is marked by three stages: the <i>first</i>
stage is short and characterized by mental exhilaration; in the
<i>second</i> stage the pupils are greatly contracted (pin-point), the
respirations are slow, the pulse is slow and full, and there is deep
stupor. In the <i>third</i> stage the patient can no longer be aroused
(coma), the respiration becomes shallow and irregular, the pulse
becomes rapid and weak, the pupils finally dilate, and the patient dies
from failure of the respiration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Even after small doses of opium many patients suffer from headache
and nausea. Children are much more sensitive to its action than
adults. Morphin resembles opium in action, but is more powerful,
less nauseating, and less constipating. Codein is less powerful as a
hypnotic and less depressing than morphin.</p>

<p>The <i>dose</i> of <i>opium</i> is from ¬Ω to 1 grain (0.03-0.65
gm.); of the <i>Extract of Opium</i> (Extractum Opii), ‚Öõ to ¬Ω grain
(0.008-0.03 gm.); of the <i>Tincture of Opium</i> or <i>Laudanum</i>
(Tinctura Opii), 10 to 20 minims (0.6-1.2 c.c.); of the <i>Camphorated

(sulphate, hydrochlorate, etc.), ‚Öõ to ¬Ω grain (0.008-0.03 gm.), and of
<i>codein</i>, ¬Ω to 1 grain (0.03-0.06 gm.).</p>

<p><i>Heroin</i> is chiefly used to allay cough. The <i>dose</i> is

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Paraldehyd.</b>‚ÄîThis is an oily liquid,
having a peculiar unpleasant odor and taste. It is used chiefly as
a hypnotic. While comparatively safe and reliable, its disagreeable

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Physostigma.</b>‚ÄîThis is the seed of a
climbing plant growing in Africa. Its activities depend upon an
alkaloid known as <i>eserin</i> or <i>physostigmin</i>. It depresses
the spinal cord, stimulates the peristaltic movements of the bowel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
and, when applied to the eye,
contracts the pupil. It is employed to check certain convulsions
(tetanus and strychnin-poisoning), to overcome atonic constipation,

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Pilocarpus</b>, or <b>Jaborandi</b>.‚ÄîThis
is the leaves of a South American plant. Its virtues depend entirely
upon an alkaloid known as <i>pilocarpin</i>. The chief action of the
drug is on the secretions‚Äîsweat, saliva, and urine‚Äîwhich it markedly
increases. Large doses depress the circulation. Locally, in the eye,
it contracts the pupil like eserin. It is mainly employed internally
as a diaphoretic in Bright‚Äôs disease and dropsical conditions.
The <i>dose</i> of the <i>Fluid Extract</i> (Extractum Pilocarpi
Fluidum) is from 20 to 60 minims (1.5-4 c.c.); of <i>pilocarpin</i>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Salicylates.</b>‚ÄîThese salts are employed
in medicine chiefly as antirheumatic remedies. Their manner of
action, however, is unknown. They are also used, both internally and
externally, to some extent as antiseptics. Large doses cause ringing in
the ears, headache, deafness, nausea, and a greenish discoloration of
the urine.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of <i>salicylic acid</i> or its
salts (ammonium, sodium, strontium) is from 5 to 20 grains (0.3-1.3

(0.3-1.2 c.c.). These preparations should be given after meals, well
diluted.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The following remedies have properties like
the salicylates, but are less powerful and less irritant to the

1 to 4 fluidrams.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Silver.</b>‚ÄîThe most important salt of
this metal is the <i>nitrate</i>. Locally, in concentrated form, the
latter is a caustic; in dilute form it is a sedative, astringent, and
antiseptic. Internally, in small doses, silver nitrate is useful as an
astringent and antiseptic in inflammatory and ulcerative conditions of
the stomach and bowel.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The prolonged use of the drug, even in small
doses, is followed by a permanent grayish discoloration of the skin
(argyria) from the precipitation of the metal in the tissues.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Toxic doses of silver nitrate cause burning pain

<p class="blockquot">Several combinations of metallic silver with
albumin are much used as antiseptics and astringents in inflammatory
diseases of mucous membranes. They have advantage over silver nitrate
in being less irritating and in not being decomposed by the juices
of the tissues. The most important of these organic compounds are
<i>protargol</i> and <i>argyrol</i>. They are usually applied in
solutions of from 1 to 10 per cent. A soluble form of metallic silver
is also employed in the form of 15 per cent. ointment, known as
<i>Cred√©‚Äôs ointment</i>. It is recommended as an antiseptic in various
infectious diseases.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Sulphonal.</b>‚ÄîThis artificial compound is
used almost entirely as a hypnotic. In single doses it is comparatively
safe and reliable, but slow in its action. Languor, headache, and
drowsiness not infrequently follow its use. The repeated administration
of sulphonal over several days or weeks is distinctly dangerous, being
often followed by chronic poisoning. The latter is marked by a red
coloration of the urine, colicky pains, profound depression, weakness,
and collapse.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of sulphonal is from 10 to 30
grains (0.6-2 gm.). It is best given in hot tea or hot milk, one or two
hours before bedtime.</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Tannic Acid, Tannin.</b>‚ÄîThis is
employed externally as an astringent and styptic, and internally as an
astringent in atonic diarrheas. It is used in the form of a gargle or
in troches in relaxed conditions of the throat, in solution to prevent
bed-sores, and in the form of ointment or suppositories for the relief
of internal piles. <i>Dose</i>, 1 to 10 grains.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Trional.</b>‚ÄîThis remedy resembles sulphonal

the same <i>dose</i> and manner as sulphonal.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><b>Urotropin.</b>‚ÄîThis compound, prepared by the
action of ammonia on formaldehyd, is employed as a powerful urinary

urine.</p>

<p class="neg-indent spa2"><b>Veratrum Viride.</b>‚ÄîThis is the root
of a North American herb. Its action resembles that of aconite in
that it depresses the heart and slows the pulse. It is, however, more
nauseating than aconite, and when locally applied does not cause
numbness, tingling, and anesthesia. Large doses cause vomiting,
muscular weakness, dizziness, sweating, failure of pulse, and collapse.
It is used as a sedative in acute inflammatory diseases to subdue
overaction of the heart.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The <i>dose</i> of the <i>tincture of veratrum

<p>Alkalis should be given before food. Iodin and iodids should be given
on an empty stomach, when they rapidly diffuse into the blood. If given
during digestion the acids and starch alter and weaken the digestion.
Acids, as a rule, should be given between the digestive acts, because
the mucous membrane of the stomach is in a favorable condition for
the diffusion of the acids into the blood. Acids may be given before
food when prescribed to check the excessive formation of the acids of
the gastric juice. By giving it before meals you check the osmosis
stomachward of the acid-forming materials. Irritating and dangerous
drugs should be given directly after food, such as the salts of
arsenic, copper, zinc, and iron, except where local conditions require
their administration in small doses before food. Oxid and nitrate of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
silver should be given after process of digestion is ended; if
given during food, chemic reactions destroy or impair their special
attributes and defeat the object for which they were prescribed.
Metallic salts, especially corrosive sublimate, also tannin and pure
alcohol, impair the digestive power of the active principle of the
gastric juice, so should appear in the stomach during its period of
inactivity. Malt extracts, cod-liver oil, phosphates, etc., should be
given with or directly after food, so that they may enter the blood
with the products of digestion.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">THE METHOD OF ADMINISTERING NUTRITIVE<br> OR STIMULATING ENEMAS.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">Prepare the fluid and heat to between 100¬∞-110¬∞
F. Pour the mixture into an enema pail or douche bag. To the tubing
attach a large rubber catheter or small rectal tube by means of a glass
nozzle. Place the patient on the left side with the knees flexed.
Permit the fluid to flow through the tube to expel the air and then
make pressure close to the point until ready to introduce it. Lubricate
the catheter with vaselin or oil and insert gently eight or nine
inches. Do not slip the catheter forward or backward unless absolutely
necessary to encourage the fluid to flow, for it only increases the
peristalsis and induces the patient to expel the contents which should
be retained. Press the tube sufficiently to allow the solution to run
very slowly, and occasionally make intermittent stoppage until it has
all been given. Upon withdrawing the tube make digital pressure with a
soft cloth against the anus for a minute or two. The use of an enema
pail in place of a funnel insures more favorable results. Moreover, it
is an easier and cleaner method and gives the advantage of having only
the tube to take care of.</p>

<p>Cantharides is used for this purpose, either as a plaster or in liquid
form; that is, in the form of vesicating collodion. Its most frequent
use is as a plaster, rarely over one and a half inches square. Scrub
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the parts well with soap and water, and dry and rub with a soft cloth
until the skin is red, then apply the plaster and bandage lightly,
so there may be plenty of room for the formation of the blister.
Vesication is produced generally within four to eight hours; if it
is not, the plaster should be removed and the operation completed by
applying a poultice. Great care should be exercised when blistering
patients suffering from kidney affections. Cantharides is an acute
irritant, and not infrequently causes strangury or acute nephritis.
When the cantharidal collodion is used the space to be covered is
outlined with oil to prevent spreading; the collodion is applied with
a camel‚Äôs hair brush or other applicator, and covered with a layer of
soft lint and oil silk.</p>

<p><i>Dressing the Blister.</i>‚ÄîPuncture the lower part of the bleb;
absorb the fluid with a piece of soft cotton; anoint with pure vaselin,
and apply a soft dressing. Bandage lightly.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to have the fluid reabsorbed into the system,
in which case precautions must be taken to prevent the blister from rupturing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">URINE ANALYSIS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Normal urine is a clear, watery fluid, with an acid reaction and a
specific gravity of from 1018 to 1020. It is composed of inorganic
salts, organic constituents, together with some coloring and a small
amount of mucus.</p>

<p>The most important of these inorganic salts are chlorid of sodium,
phosphate of potassium, and the sulphates of calcium and magnesium.
The inorganic constituents are chiefly urea, uric acid, and poisonous
inorganic substances found in the body. The normal amount of urine
voided by an adult weighing 160 pounds is from 40 to 70 ounces in
twenty-four hours. The amount may be increased by drinking large
quantities of fluid, especially water, and diminished by perspiration,
emotion, and copious bowel movements.</p>

<p><i>Normal urine</i> is aromatic. In health it may be faintly alkaline
at certain times of the day. Urine passed in the morning has an acid
reaction, a high specific gravity, and a dark color. After a hearty
meal it may be turbid‚Äîperhaps alkaline, and of low specific gravity.
Large quantities are pale, and vary with concentration. When just
passed it is clear; then it collects a cloudy material made up of
mucous corpuscles, which can be easily shaken up. Concentrated urine,
when it cools, deposits a pinkish (brick-dust) precipitate. Gentle heat
clears it up. When highly concentrated the crystals are red. When they
collect and adhere together they become stones; if all precipitate on
heating it is normal urine.</p>

<p><i>Alkaline urine</i> throws down phosphates that are held in solution
and clears up on addition of any acid; if urine is cold and acid in
reaction, sediment, if present, may be urates, but is not phosphates;
if urine is alkaline, they are normal phosphates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">TO TEST REACTION.</h3>

<p>Litmus-paper is used. Acid changes the blue to red. Alkaline changes
red to blue. When urine does not affect litmus-paper it is said to be
neutral.</p>

<p><i>Pus in urine</i> is turbid or milky in appearance; after standing a
while it settles down.</p>

<p><i>Albumin in urine</i> is held in solution, and therefore cannot be seen.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">A SIMPLE AND RAPID TEST FOR ALBUMIN.</h3>

<p>Fill an ordinary test-tube half full of urine, and add a half dram or
more of potassium ferrocyanid solution (1 to 20). After thoroughly
mingling the urine and the reagent, add a few drops of acetic acid
(50 per cent.); then pause for a half minute and note the change.
If albumin be present it will come plainly into view within half
a minute to a minute, in the form of white, milk-like opacity,
diffused throughout the whole contents of the tube. The above method
precipitates all modifications of albumin. On the other hand, it gives
no reaction with phosphates, peptones, mucin, the alkaloids, urates,
or the pure acids. The reaction that sometimes occurs on long standing
between the acid and potassium ferrocyanid should not be mistaken for
albumin. The albuminous reaction appears within half a minute or so,
while the other occurs only after ten minutes to half an hour, and is
mingled with more or less blue coloration.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TO OBTAIN A 24-HOUR SPECIMEN OF URINE.</h3>

<p>Begin early in the morning. <i>Throw away the first urination.</i>
Save <i>all</i> further urinations for the next twenty-four hours. For
instance: Patient urinates at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> <i>This first urination
is thrown away</i>, or saved for an <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> specimen if required
and patient‚Äôs bladder is empty. Save all succeeding urinations for the
next twenty-four hours, at the end of which time (6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>)
request the patient to urinate, and <i>save the last</i> urination
also, to complete the specimen. This gives us twenty-four hours‚Äô secretion.</p>

<p>The addition of solution of formaldehyd (f íij) to a twenty-four hour
specimen of urine will preserve it, and prevent fermentation before the
analysis is made.</p>

chopped fine and squeezed through colander, may be a part of the
regular diet in four meals a day. A child two years old may have small
quantities of fresh fish, tender chicken, or beefsteak. No green fruits

<h3 class="spa2">RULES FOR STERILIZING BOTTLES.</h3>

<p>Boil bottles and nipples in 2 per cent. soda solution for five minutes,
then in clear water for five minutes. Keep empty bottles and nipples
not in use in sterile water or weak boric solution. Plug with raw cotton.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TO PASTEURIZE MILK.</h3>

<p>1. Place bottles in vessel of warm water. Heat to 147¬∞ F. Keep at that
temperature thirty minutes. Take vessel off stove and cover with a
heavy blanket. Then pour off hot water and fill vessel with cold water
to cool the milk quickly.</p>

<p>2. Put milk in double boiler and raise to a temperature of 150¬∞ to 155¬∞
F. Let stand at this temperature for twenty to thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Pasteurizing milk does not kill the ferments in the milk, but it kills
almost all bacteria except the spore-bearing bacteria, of which the gas
bacillus is the most important.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TO STERILIZE MILK.</h3>

<p>Boil milk for five minutes and then prepare as for pasteurizing,
keeping it at temperature of 147¬∞ F. for thirty minutes and cooling it
by the same process as given for pasteurization.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Boiling milk kills all bacteria. It is said that
heating of milk to this degree impairs its nutritive
value.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>‚ÄîSpores develop quickly in lukewarm milk,
therefore the necessity of cooling it quickly and
placing it in refrigerator.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">MODIFIED MILK.</h3>

<p>Add water or other substances to cow‚Äôs milk to
change it to agree with the digestion of the infant.
Malted foods when mixed with water are deficient,
and by adding milk or cream it becomes modified milk.</p>

<p>All mixtures should be cold when adding milk,
and water sterilized when used as a diluent.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>‚ÄîThe natural food for the infant is human
milk. The breast-fed babies are healthier, more
vigorous, and more resistant to disease. (See

<p>Lactose or milk-sugar is best for normal babies. It may split up in the
intestines into acids and when it ferments is likely to be a laxative.
Sucrose (cane-sugar) has no advantage over lactose, except that it is
cheaper. Do not give sucrose if other sugars are on hand.</p>

<p>Maltose (malt-sugar) is expensive and is never given pure.</p>

<p>Dissolve all sugars in warm sterilized water. Malt extract is more
laxative than other milk-sugar preparations. Malt extract should be
brought to boiling-point only.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOOTHACHE: Its Forms, Diagnosis, and Treatment for Relief.</h2>
</div>

<p>The <b>sharp, paroxysmal, shooting</b> pain which is caused by
the application of cold, heat, sweets or sours, or by biting some
substances into a cavity, is due to a live pulp, and the treatment is
quite simple. Clean out the cavity as well as possible, then saturate
a small pellet of cotton with oil of cloves, or one drop of carbolic
acid, or a solution of cocaine hydrochlorate and clove oil. Place this
in the cavity and add another pellet of cotton to prevent the solution
from being washed out by saliva. Relief should be immediate, but if
not, reapply within a few minutes.</p>

<p>The <b>dull, throbbing</b> pain, with swelling of the face and a
sensation of elongation of the tooth, is caused by either a putrescent
pulp or an imperfect root canal filling. There is infection; therefore,
the first thing to do is to remove the pus.</p>

<p><i>Dental Treatment.</i>‚ÄîIf there is a large cavity in the tooth,
try to enter the root canals and remove the putrescent matter. If the
face is badly swollen, make a digital examination, and over the root
of the affected tooth you will find a spot about the center of the
swelling where it seems to be spongy, appearing to hold the impress
of the finger. Take a clean, sharp, cycle-shaped lancet, place on the
spot, holding the patient‚Äôs head firm with your other arm for fear of
his moving. Press the lancet firmly and directly through to the bone,
then draw it out with a pulling motion so as to make a cut about an
eighth of an inch or more. If this has been done properly, a creamy
flow of pus should follow the lancet. Place the fingers on either side
of the incision and massage toward incision. To relieve the pain,
give <i>hot</i> foot-baths, <i>cold</i> applications to face (never
<i>hot</i>), and some other sedative internally, such as remedies given
for a headache. When a tooth is sore to percussion, so that the food
cannot be masticated, but is without pain when left at rest, if there
is no pain over the root of the tooth, it is best to give the tooth a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
rest, and apply counterirritants over the roots of the adjacent teeth.</p>

<p>This condition is called <b>apical pericementitis</b>, an inflammation
of the layer of bone about the fangs of teeth. For relief, give hot
foot-baths and pain remedies, as in abscessed tooth. A dead pulp in a
tooth will form gas and cause the sensation of elongation and soreness.
If the putrefaction is not removed, an abscess will result. At first
there will be no soreness to pressure over the root, but on application
of heat, such as drinking hot coffee, there will be pain, while cold
water will temporarily remove it.</p>

<p><i>Dental Treatment.</i>‚ÄîOpen the chamber and remove the putrescent
pulp, being careful not to go beyond the apical foramen. Use a
barbed broach, then wash out with peroxide of hydrogen on a thread
of absorbent cotton wrapped smoothly about the broach. Do not push
the instrument up into the canal very far for fear of sending some
putrescent matter beyond the tooth. Then withdraw the broach and apply
oil of cloves or carbolic acid, leaving the canal open and clean for
the gas to escape. Hot foot-baths and headache remedies will relieve
the pain.</p>

<p><b>Gum-boils</b> are abscessed teeth, and may be deep-rooted or very
superficial. The treatment is the same as given above. Hot applications
are very often prescribed, but as an infection will always follow the
line of least resistance, it can be readily understood why such a
treatment should not be given. The abscess may gather in the cheek,
necessitating lancing, which will leave a scar. Cold cloths will allay
the infection and simplify the treatment to the gums alone. Teeth are
withdrawn, leaving unsightly cavities, which could be avoided by a
more deliberate treatment. Treat the abscess of the tooth the same as
an abscess in any other part of the body, thereby saving the root of
the tooth, if not the entire portion, which can be crowned and give a
permanent good tooth.</p>

<p>Mastication is the most important part of the digestive system, and
mastication cannot be done without good teeth. Therefore, it behooves
everyone to preserve his own teeth and to give this benefit to others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
who may not have had dental treatment. There are dentists who will
extract a tooth upon the patient‚Äôs request, and it is best to seek the
most progressive and modern dental doctors for the preservation of
the teeth to prevent the untimely loss of a tooth, which means also
many times a preventive against other ailments affecting the digestive
tract. A good dentist should be consulted at least once a year,
although the teeth may appear sound and in good condition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NURSING IN ACUTE FEVERS.</h2>
</div>

<h3>TYPHOID OR ENTERIC FEVER.</h3>

<p>Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease, excited by the <i>typhoid
bacillus</i>. It is most prevalent in the autumn, although it occurs
at all seasons. The disease is not directly contagious, and can only
be acquired by taking the special bacillus into the alimentary canal.
This is usually accomplished through the medium of polluted water, milk
contaminated with infected water, raw vegetables (celery, lettuce,
water-cress) which have grown in infected soil, or raw shell-fish
(oysters) taken from the beds of polluted streams. Occasionally
physicians and nurses are infected directly in handling the patient or
his clothing which has become soiled with his discharges.</p>

<p>The bacilli are contained in nearly all the secretions of the patients,
especially in the stools and urine.</p>

<p>While the bacilli are widely distributed through tissues, the only
characteristic lesions of the disease are in the glands of the
intestines (Peyer‚Äôs patches), which in the first few days become red
and swollen, about the beginning of the second week soft and pale, and
in the third week ulcerated. If the patient survive, cicatrization
usually begins in the fourth week.</p>

<p>Death may result from exhaustion, the result of the systemic poisoning,
from perforation of the bowel by an ulcer, from intestinal hemorrhage,
the result of erosion of a blood-vessel, or from some complication,
like pneumonia.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>‚ÄîThe <i>initial symptoms</i>, which may last a week
or two before there is any fever, are headache, weakness, loss of
appetite, nose-bleed, and perhaps slight diarrhea.</p>

<p>The <i>fever</i> rises gradually, reaching its maximum (104¬∞-105¬∞ F.)
in about a week; it remains stationary for one, two, or three weeks,
and then falls, reaching the normal in another week, thus making the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
febrile period of the disease of four or five weeks‚Äô duration.
Throughout its course the evening temperature is apt to be two or three
degrees higher than the morning temperature.</p>

<p>The abdominal symptoms consist of distention of the abdomen
(tympanitis), pain and tenderness in the right iliac region, and often
diarrhea.</p>

<p>Between the seventh and ninth days a rash usually appears on the
abdomen, consisting of small rose-red spots. These come out in crops
and disappear on pressure.</p>

<p>The <i>pulse</i> becomes rapid and feeble, and the heart sounds become
weak and dull.</p>

<p>The <i>respiratory symptoms</i> include cough, hurried breathing, and
slight expectoration.</p>

<p><i>Nervous symptoms</i> are not always marked. In severe cases there
may be delirium, stupor, twitching of the muscles, picking at the
bed-clothes, and coma.</p>

<p>The <i>face</i> is dull and listless. The <i>tongue</i> is coated and
tremulous. In severe cases it becomes dry, brown, and fissured, and
sordes tend to collect upon the teeth.</p>

<p>Relapses are common. In some cases they are due to the too early use of
solid food, to excitement, or to overexertion.</p>

<p>When typhoid fever is prevalent, the most reliable <i>preventive
measures</i> consist in thorough boiling of all water and milk used for
drinking purposes and the avoidance of uncooked vegetables, oysters,
and shell-fish.</p>

<p><b>Management.</b>‚ÄîUnless otherwise directed take <i>temperature</i>,
<i>respiration</i>, and <i>pulse</i> every three hours, in mouth or
axilla, as desired. If for any reason a change is made in taking
temperature, it should be noted on the chart. Note the effect of
<i>sponging</i> or of <i>bathing</i> upon temperature and pulse. Note
the character of pulse, and effect, if any, which stimulants have
had upon it. Note the amount of <i>cough</i>, and the character and
quantity of the <i>expectoration</i>; also any pain that may occur in
the chest.</p>

<p>Note the amount of <i>flatulence</i> and the number and character of
the <i>stools</i>; especially be on the lookout for blood or undigested
food in the discharges.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Note carefully any <i>abdominal pain</i>, any <i>increase in the
distention</i>, as these symptoms, with or without a rather abrupt
<i>fall in temperature</i>, <i>chills</i>, and <i>pinched features</i>,
are suggestive of perforation.</p>

<p><b>Treatment for Hemorrhage.</b>‚ÄîStop all orders immediately,
including diet. Elevate the foot of the bed. Give morphin sulphate, gr.
¬º (gm. 0.015), hypodermically, and apply an ice coil or iced compresses
to the abdomen until the physician arrives.</p>

<p>Note the occurrence of <i>vomiting</i> and the character of vomit.</p>

<p>Be on the lookout for retention of <i>urine</i>, which is quite
common. Note the amount of urine passed in a day and any abnormalities
connected with its appearance.</p>

<p>Note the condition of the <i>skin</i> and <i>tongue</i>.</p>

<p>Note the amount of <i>sleep</i>, its character, whether quiet or
restless and whether or not there have been delirium, stupor, or
twitching of the muscles.</p>

<p>Note the exact amount and character of <i>nourishment</i> taken, and
the time it was given; also the amount, time of administration, and
effect of <i>medicines</i> and <i>stimulants</i>.</p>

<p>Cleanse the mouth and teeth frequently with some antiseptic wash, such
as listerine, 1 part; water, 3 parts.</p>

<p>Bed-sores can nearly always be prevented by keeping the patient and
bedding perfectly clean, the skin absolutely dry, and the bed-linen
smooth. Changes of position are also important. Parts subjected to
pressure and soiling should be washed at least twice daily with soap
and water, thoroughly dried, gently rubbed with alcohol, and then
dusted with a powder like the following:</p>

<table class="no-wrap" >

   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>If the skin be reddened and tender it may be painted with collodion and
then dusted. When the part cannot be kept dry, it should be smeared with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
zinc ointment and powdered. In very prolonged cases it usually becomes
necessary to use water- or air-pillows or water- or air-beds.</p>

<p>To <i>disinfect the feces and urine</i>, use a solution of chlorinated
soda (Labarraque‚Äôs solution). Cover the urine and feces with the
solution and leave the contents stand for an hour. Cleanse pan
thoroughly and pour into it the Labarraque solution.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">PNEUMONIA.</h3>

<p>Pneumonia is a general infection, excited by a special organism‚Äîthe
pneumococcus‚Äîand manifested by a local inflammatory process in the
lung and severe systemic disturbances.</p>

<p>Exposure to cold and lowered vitality from overwork, alcoholism, or
some previous disease render persons liable to infection.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>‚ÄîThese consist in a decided chill, pain in the side,
fever rising rapidly to 104¬∞-105¬∞ F., and lasting for five, seven,
nine, or eleven days, and then rapidly falling; cough; tenacious bloody
expectoration, shortness of breath, delirium and stupor, and physical
signs indicating a solid condition of the affected lung.</p>

<p>In fatal cases death usually results from exhaustion, the result of
the systemic poisoning, but occasionally it is due to a failure of
the heart to propel the blood through the solid lung, to suffocation,
or a complication, such as inflammation of the covering of the heart
(pericarditis) or lining of the heart (endocarditis).</p>

<p><b>Management.</b>‚ÄîThe room should be well ventilated, but free from
drafts. The temperature should be maintained between 65¬∞ and 70¬∞ F.
Cool water should be given freely. The points mentioned in connection
with temperature, respiration, and pulse in dealing with typhoid fever
are applicable here. Note the frequency of cough, the amount and
character of expectoration, and whether the latter is raised readily
or with difficulty. Note the occurrence of pain and its location; also
amount of sleep, amount of nourishment, amount of urine, number of
stools, etc., and the effect of sponging, of medicines, and of local
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
applications. Clean the mouth and teeth at intervals, being extremely
careful, however, in all manipulations not to tire or exhaust the patient.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">SCARLET FEVER.</h3>

<p>Scarlet fever is an acute, highly contagious disease characterized by a
sudden onset with chill, vomiting, or convulsions; a high fever of from
a week to ten days‚Äô duration; a very rapid pulse; severe sore throat; a
bright red rash, appearing on the second day, lasting about a week, and
followed by desquamation and a marked tendency to nephritis.</p>

<p>The most serious complications are nephritis, suppurative inflammation
of the middle ear (otitis media), inflammation of the endocardium or
pericardium, and pneumonia.</p>

<p>Scarlet fever, while contagious at all periods, is probably most so
during the period of desquamation. The organism may cling to furniture,
clothing, etc., and reproduce the disease after very long periods. The
contagion may be carried by persons coming in contact with the sick,
or the disease may be transmitted through the air of the sick-room or
through clothing, utensils, etc., which have been used by the sick.</p>

<p><b>Prevention of contagion</b> consists in isolating the patient; in
disinfecting everything that has been in contact with him; in anointing
the patient‚Äôs body with an antiseptic oil until desquamation is complete;
and in thoroughly disinfecting the room after the patient‚Äôs removal.</p>

<p><b>Management.</b>‚ÄîHave the patient, if possible, in a large, airy
room, preferably at the top of the house. Keep the temperature uniform
and the room well ventilated. Wear a loose wrapper and cap, and leave
these inside the room when obliged to leave it.</p>

<p>With cloths moistened with a 3 per cent. solution of carbolic acid wipe
the floor, furniture, sills, door-knobs, mantelpiece, etc., once a day,
but never dust or sweep. Thoroughly disinfect the secretions of the
patient and all articles used by him before they leave the room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Allow the patient no food except what has been ordered, which will
usually be milk, koumiss, junket, fruit-juices, and gruels. Encourage
the patient to drink water freely. Apply to the body, at least once a
day, a bland ointment. Note temperature, respiration, pulse, stools,
quantity of nourishment, sleep, and effect of baths and medicine as
in typhoid fever. Note especially the quantity and appearance of the
urine, and have a sample in a clean bottle ready each day for the
physician‚Äôs examination.</p>

<p>Keep the nose and throat clean with mild antiseptic sprays or
washes. Relieve pain in the throat, unless otherwise directed, with
ice-poultices or hot-water compresses.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">MEASLES.</h3>

<p>Measles is an acute contagious disease characterized by moderate fever
of about a week‚Äôs duration; by an eruption on the skin, appearing on
the third or fourth day as small red spots that soon coalesce into
crescentic blotches, remain three or four days, and then disappear with
a branny desquamation; and by catarrhal symptoms involving the eyes,
nose, and bronchial tubes (conjunctivitis, coryza, and bronchitis).
The most common complications of the disease are catarrhal pneumonia,
inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract, and inflammation of the
middle ear.</p>

<p><b>Management.</b>‚ÄîThe preventive measures described in connection
with scarlet fever are applicable in measles. The room should be
maintained at a temperature of 70¬∞ F., and should be moderately
darkened. The bed should be so arranged that the face will be
directed away from the light. Milk, broths, and gruels are suitable
forms of nourishment. The temperature, pulse, respiration, hours of
sleep, quantity of nourishment, amount of urine, and the effects of
therapeutic measures should be carefully noted as in other fevers.
Daily inunctions of the body with cold cream or olive oil are useful.
Spraying the nose and throat with a mild antiseptic solution, and
washing the eyes with boric acid solution (15 grains to the ounce of
water) are usually ordered. Hot baths and hot drinks are indicated when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the rash is delayed. Fever is generally controlled by sponging. Great
care is necessary during convalescence to avert complications.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">DIPHTHERIA.</h3>

<p>Diphtheria is an acute contagious disease characterized by moderate
fever of an irregular type, and of from one to two weeks‚Äô duration;
by considerable weakness and prostration; and by the formation of a
grayish or whitish false membrane upon the throat, nose, larynx, and
adjacent parts. The exciting cause of disease is the <i>bacillus of
diphtheria</i>, which is found chiefly in secretions of the affected
mucous membrane. The constitutional symptoms are due to the absorption
of a toxin produced by this bacillus.</p>

<p>Diphtheria involving the larynx is sometimes termed <i>true croup</i>
or pseudomembranous croup. This form is characterized by irregular
fever, hoarseness of the voice, croupy cough, and progressive
difficulty in breathing. Death frequently results from suffocation,
unless tracheotomy or intubation of the larynx be performed.</p>

<p>The chief <b>complications</b> of diphtheria are pneumonia,
degeneration of the heart-muscle, inflammation of the middle ear, and
paralysis the result of an inflammation of the nerves.</p>

<p><b>Preventive measures</b> consist in isolation of the sick, the
thorough disinfection of the bedroom, bedding, clothing, and all
articles used by the sick, and the administration of an immunizing dose
(500 units) of antitoxin (see page 25) to those who have already come
in contact with the patient or who have otherwise been exposed to the
contagion. The sick-room should be well ventilated and maintained at a
temperature of 70¬∞ F. The atmosphere should be made moist by slaking
lime in the room or by generating steam in a kettle. In membranous
laryngitis treatment in a steam-moistened tent is desirable. On account
of the tendency to sudden heart failure absolute quiet and rest are
to be enjoined. The diet should consist of milk, unseasoned broths,
koumiss, junket, and eggs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The patient‚Äôs temperature, pulse, respiration, nourishment, urine,
sleep, and bowel movements should be noted as in other fevers. Local
applications of boric acid solution, hydrogen peroxid (1: 3), or
normal salt solution are usually ordered; they should be made with
utmost gentleness. Externally, ice-poultices or hot fomentations are
useful in relieving soreness.</p>

<p>The utmost care should be exercised during convalescence to guard the
patient against undue effort, as at this time sudden heart failure is
especially liable to occur.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">POLIOMYELITIS.</h3>

<p><b>Poliomyelitis‚ÄîInfantile Paralysis.</b>‚ÄîThis disease occurs in
all countries and was recognized more than a hundred years ago. The
first of the great epidemics appeared in 1905, and it was then proved
that the malady is a contagious disease. Peculiar facts connected
with previous epidemics of poliomyelitis have made it appear possible
that the disease when not spread directly from one person to another,
like the most acute infectious diseases, may be dependent upon some
intermediate agent, or perhaps upon some other host, or a living
reservoir, or upon the combination of the two. If the disease is
communicated by human contact, mild cases, abortive cases, and
convalescents may carry the germs for years. A normal carrier is an
individual who is not suffering from the disease and may carry the
germs and transmit them to another without being the least suspected.
Laboratory experiments would seem to show that the disease is passed
directly from one affected human individual to another through
immediate contact involving the transfer of the virus from the first
person to the nasal passages of the second, and spread through the
agency of dust or by various other means, a population other than
human, one acting as an undercurrent and influencing the progress
of the epidemic. There seems to be no relation between the sanitary
conditions and the incidence of cases. Poliomyelitis is most prevalent
during the warm months, even when it is not epidemic. Under the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
conditions of temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloudiness, sunshine,
wind, dust, etc., the outbreak will progress in one part of the city
and subside in another. The course of the epidemic is not materially
modified by weather conditions. No age, no sex, or race is exempt; the
incidence is greater under five years of age, and the blonde children
appear to be especially susceptible, while the colored race are rarely
attacked, and the strongest children seem to be the greatest sufferers.
That this disease can and often does end fatally has been clearly
shown by the history of the past epidemics, and it has been frequently
demonstrated by clinicians in various parts of the world that complete
recovery from paralysis is not only possible but it is by no means
uncommon.</p>

<p><b>Summary Results from Public School Reports.</b>‚Äî1. A large number
of children with poliomyelitis show pathologic conditions of the nose
and throat, either diseased and hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids, or
both.</p>

<p>2. A large number show marked hyperemia of the nasopharynx and throat,
often resembling a scarlet or streptococcus throat.</p>

<p>3. Only a small percentage of cases previously operated for tonsils
and adenoids were found to be affected with the disease, and in this
group of cases the percentage of recovery was very much higher than
in unoperated cases. The number of cases in this group is, of course,
rather small to draw from it any definite conclusion, but it is at
least suggestive. In another investigation of 1404 children in the
public schools, made to determine whether any of them whose tonsils
had been removed had been ill with poliomyelitis during the recent
epidemic, a similar result was obtained. Of the 1404 children whose
tonsils had been operated upon not one developed poliomyelitis during
this epidemic, although in 18 instances cases developed in the family,
and in 93 instances cases developed in the same house.</p>

<p>Poliomyelitis defined: <i>Polio</i> (gray), <i>myel</i> (marrow),
<i>itis</i> (inflammation), meaning inflammation of the gray matter of
the spinal cord.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p><b>Pathology</b> of the disease: Infantile paralysis is a general
infection, with lesions most marked in the central nervous system.
Clinical manifestations exhibit a wide-spread and scattered motor
paralysis or weakening. The large majority of all cases are of the
central nervous system, but there are variations in which the symptoms
are not of the usual kind.</p>

<p><b>Classification.</b>‚Äî1. <i>Non-paralytic or Abortive
Type.</i>‚ÄîThese are cases in which the nerve-cells are not
sufficiently injured to produce paralysis; and those classed as
meningitis cases, tuberculous meningitis without motor disturbances,
often called encephalitic; in these cases the motor cortical areas are
not involved, but there is evidence of disturbance of the sensorium.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ataxic Type.</i>‚ÄîHere the motor cells are evidently not
involved, but there is a lack of co-ordination‚Äîataxia, nystagmus.</p>

<p>3. <i>Cortical Type.</i>‚ÄîThe upper motor neuron is here affected, with
resulting spastic paralysis.</p>

<p>4. <i>Ordinary Spinal or Subcortical Type.</i>‚ÄîHere the lower motor
neuron is affected, with resulting flaccid paralysis; a manifestation
of poliomyelitis difficult to classify is blindness. The most important
symptoms of the disease may be described under the <i>non-paralytic</i>
or <i>abortive</i> cases and those of <i>ordinary spinal form</i>.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms of Onset.</b>‚ÄîThere is no typical onset for this disease.
It is believed that there is an interval of from a few days to two
weeks between the time of exposure and the appearance of symptoms. No
one symptom or group of symptoms will always be found to identify it
before the paralysis is apparent. Fever is the most constant of all
symptoms; it varies a great deal; there may be much or there may be
little. Vomiting occurs quite frequently, and in a child old enough to
talk headache may be complained of. Sometimes there is considerable
pain in the back. The child is often very drowsy and desires to be
alone. Movements of any kind seem to cause pain, and muscle tenderness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
is plainly evident. Marked irritability and sweating are also often
prominent features. Such symptoms may all appear suddenly following a
day of great activity and good health. These symptoms may continue for
from two to four days, when it is noticed that the child is unable to
move a hand, an arm, a foot, or a leg. There may merely be a paralysis
of one side of the face or only weakness in an arm or leg. In some mild
cases it is occasionally hard to convince parents of the true nature
of the disease. In some instances the first knowledge of a child‚Äôs
indisposition is the discovery that it cannot walk or has difficulty in
using an arm. Cases of this character are often attributed to ‚Äúcatching
cold,‚Äù to going in bathing for too long, or perhaps a fall.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases temperature is down to normal within a week
and there is seldom an extension of the paralysis after that time. In
most instances all the paralysis which is going to occur is present at
the time it is first noticed.</p>

<p>Within two weeks all the tenderness has usually left the muscles, which
are now found to be soft and flabby from lack of use. No matter what
extremity may be affected by the paralysis, there is one condition
which is nearly always present in these cases. If the child‚Äôs shoulders
are raised up from the bed, the head drops back almost as if on a
string. The child is unable to keep its head in a line with the body,
and if the head is raised and forcibly bent forward so as to cause the
chin to touch the chest, marked pain results.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>‚ÄîBy the end of three weeks in favorable cases there
may be some motion obtained by the patient in the limb which was
paralyzed, or there may be evidence of threatened deformity. It is at
this time and in the weeks and months to follow that so much depends
upon treatment. The muscles of a leg or arm may waste away so as to
make them useless if not promptly cared for. If contractions of muscles
are not prevented, a club-foot, toe-drop, or some similar deformity may
develop. <i>Such deformities may be hastened by the pressure of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
bed-clothes.</i> At times it is well to put a wire cradle over the
affected limbs. Well-padded splints seem to take the strain from
unaffected muscles.</p>

<p>By some wonderful adaptation of nature there is a great effort to make
other nerve channels take up the work of the destroyed cells, and
hence the value of keeping the muscles artificially active by the use
of massage and mild electric treatment. This treatment should be used
early in the case, and then only with the advice and supervision of a
competent physician.</p>

<p>The destruction of nerve-cells in the segment of the spinal cord is
sometimes so extreme that a total paralysis of one or more extremities
follows. This is a grave shock to the growing child, and it may be
that all growth of that member will stop. The long bones will not
lengthen. If one group of muscles remain active and unopposed in their
action, deformity will follow. These deformities can be corrected by
the orthopedic surgeon, and can usually be checked if the physician‚Äôs
advice is sought.</p>

<p><i>Serum Treatment.</i>‚ÄîThe serum injections were given even as long
as thirty years ago. Intraspinal injection of an immune serum is
effective when introduced in the preparalytic stage.</p>

<p><i>Prophylaxis.</i>‚ÄîThe <i>virus</i> or germ of <i>poliomyelitis</i>
is found <i>in the nose, the mouth, and intestinal tract</i> (it
is also found in various other parts of the body). As house-flies
may carry the virus after crawling over the person suffering from
the disease, all insects are a dangerous asset to any household.
Disinfection of secreta and excreta should be carried out. The mouth
and nose should be disinfected.</p>

<p><b>Quarantine</b> should be rigidly enforced, and all the necessary
precautions taken to prevent the spread of a contagious, infectious
disease.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">DISINFECTION OF FECES AND URINE.</h3>

<p>Disinfect the feces and urine by mixing with each evacuation double its
volume of 1 per cent. chlorid of lime solution or double its volume of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
5 per cent. carbolic acid solution. Cover the vessel and allow it to stand
for from one to two hours before emptying its contents into the closet.</p>

<p>Put all typhoid linens in cans used for that purpose only. Sprinkle
with formalin and keep covered until sent to laundry.</p>

<p>N. B.‚ÄîWhile performing work in which the hands come in contact with
soiled linen and bed-pans, fill finger-nails with soap to keep them
clean and to prevent them from acting as carriers of disease.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar fact that the diseases in which the period of
incubation is shortest are those in which the infection persists the longest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>The period of quarantine must be guided largely by the period of
incubation, hence the subject is an important one for a variety of
reasons. The ‚ÄúMedical Magazine‚Äù (London) states that the period of
quarantine should be at least a day longer than the maximum period
of incubation for each disease. This is a very uncertain rule,
however, for the patient should be free from all signs of illness,
and especially from fever. The period of infection is very doubtful.
It may be greatly prolonged by complications. This is especially
true of small-pox, diphtheria, typhoid and scarlet fevers. The period
during which a disease may be infectious cannot be stated definitely.
It varies with different diseases, and must be determined according
to the symptoms and character of the case. Measles, chicken-pox, and
mumps lose the direct power of infection very early, and the infective
principle does not remain active for a long period in the room in
which the patient has been ill. Measles, mumps, and chicken-pox may be
infectious in the earlier stages before becoming definite in character.
Smallpox is not actually dangerous until the eruption appears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CARE OF THE SKIN<br> AND MOUTH IN FEVERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="f110"><span class="smcap">By Harriet Higbee</span>,<br>
Graduate Illinois Training School for Nurses.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the American Journal of Nursing.</i></p>

<p>The prevention and treatment of bed-sores have been and are frequently
discussed in medical books and journals. But as it is a subject that
often taxes the nurse‚Äôs ingenuity to the extreme, it can not be dwelt
upon too frequently. Many preventive measures are familiar to us, as
the soap and water bath for cleanliness, followed by rubbing with
alcohol and dusting with boric-acid powder, or boric-acid powder
and bismuth subnitrate in equal parts for dryness. <i>The relief of
pressure is most important.</i> Make use of air-cushions, cotton-pads,
pillows, water-bed and <i>frequent change of position</i> where that is
possible. In addition to these, there are a few measures not generally
used which after a thorough test have proved satisfactory. One is a
simple inexpensive contrivance used to relieve pressure of heel, elbow,
and ear. It is a pig‚Äôs bladder filled two-thirds full of either warm
or cold water, as the case requires, tied securely, and placed under
a cotton ring. The weight of the head or elbow rests on the ring and
the tender point rests on the soft fluctuating mass. If the skin is
inactive, as in paralysis, or there is frequent or constant moisture
from perspiration or involuntary evacuations of urine or feces, the
alcohol and boric acid, etc., are of very little value. They do not
prevent the absorption of the moisture by the skin and its subsequent
softness or excoriation, which is commonly followed by infection. In
such cases the back should be washed with soap and water every six or
eight hours, or after every involuntary evacuation, and thoroughly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
rubbed with a small amount of oil-substance, as camphorated oil or a
mixture like the following:</p>

<p>Render out mutton tallow on the back part of the stove; do not brown
it. Strain through a piece of muslin; add the olive oil and carbolic
acid; set dish into cold water and beat its contents until set.
This will make an ointment the consistence of vaseline, and it will
keep indefinitely. If the skin needs a great deal of stimulation,
camphorated oil or, better still, castor oil may be substituted for the
olive oil in the above recipe.</p>

<p>When the skin becomes excoriated the part should be cleansed as
mentioned before, not with soap and water, but with boric-acid
solution, normal salt solution, or sterile water; then gently painted
with oxide of zinc ointment made into liquid form by the addition of
olive oil, castor oil, and balsam of Peru in equal parts, or castor
oil alone, and covered with a clean cloth fastened on with a binder.
Gentle massage may be used around the excoriated surface with excellent
results.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <b>treatment of bed-sores</b> <i>is usually directed by
the physician</i>; but if it is left to the nurse, she will find the
following method helpful. If there is necrotic tissue or suppuration
present, she may irrigate the cavity once daily with peroxid of
hydrogen, one glass syringeful, followed by normal salt solution,
boric-acid solution, or sterile water. Then apply a hot boric-acid
dressing, one inch thick, every four hours until wound is clean. If the
stimulation of the tissues is needed, fill the cavity with a sterile
dressing saturated with balsam of Peru and castor oil, equal parts
bovinine, castor oil, or camphorated oil alone. When the depression is
filled with granulation tissue, it can be treated as an excoriation.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">THE MOUTH.</h3>

<p>The subject of the care of the mouth in fever nursing is equally as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
important as that of prevention of bed-sores. An unclean mouth is
not only very unpleasant and often painful to the patient, but is a
source of infection. The accumulation of food and mucus is a fertile
field for the lodgement of bacteria. If this infected material is
allowed to remain, it can easily spread to the middle ear and the
mastoid cells, and cause abscesses or be carried by the food to the
already overburdened alimentary tract to add to its infection. When
the accumulation of sordes is profuse and persistent the patient‚Äôs
mouth ought to be cleansed after every feeding. This may be done by
wrapping a two-inch square piece of linen or gauze, saturated with the
mouth-wash, around the little finger and wiping every portion of the
cavity‚Äînot far enough on back of the tongue to provoke nausea. If it
is necessary to clean the throat, a small swab may be employed. For
thorough cleaning of the mouth several sponges are necessary. These
may be received in a piece of paper and at once burned. While cleaning
the mouth of a delirious patient the nurse for her own protection must
place some hard substance between the patient‚Äôs teeth. A rubber cork is
the best, but if that is not available, a fork-handle may be used. Its
prongs must be carefully wrapped to avoid an accident. If the cork is
used, the nurse must hold it in place to prevent its falling down the
patient‚Äôs throat. There are numerous preparations used for cleaning the
mouth, as:</p>

<p>Seal all crevices about doors and windows. Keep the room closed for
twenty-four hours to allow dust to settle. At the end of this time
vaporize in a lamp from fifty to sixty paraform tablets to each 1000
cubic feet of space or vaporize 1 pound of formaldehyd solution in
a <i>special apparatus</i> designed for the purpose. If no special
apparatus is obtainable, sprinkle sheets with the following solution,
using a gallon of the mixture for a medium-sized room, and fill the
room with steam:</p>

<table class="no-wrap fs_120 spa1" >

<p>The steam and glycerin prevent to some extent the conversion of the
formaldehyd gas into paraform, which in itself is useless.</p>

<p>Another and more modern method is to pour 12 ounces of formaldehyd into
a vessel and then add 4 ounces of crystals of potassium permanganate.
Place the vessel in the room and leave the room closed for from four to
six hours. To get rid of the fumes quickly after the disinfection is
completed, sprinkle 4 ounces of ammonia on a sheet and leave the sheet
in the room until the ammonia is evaporated.</p>

<p><i>Sulphate of copper</i> solution is a very cheap disinfectant, and
may be used to advantage in typhoid fever.</p>

<p>After this treatment again keep the room closed for four or five hours.
Then wipe floor, walls, and woodwork with corrosive sublimate solution
(1: 2000) or carbolic acid solution (3 per cent.).</p>

<h3 class="spa1">DISINFECTION IN PRIVATE NURSING.</h3>

<p>In a private home (M. D. P., <i>American Journal of Nursing</i>) if
contagion has taken the family by surprise and a room has not been
especially prepared, leave in the room all the furniture and fittings
in order that everything may be disinfected finally.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>During the progress of the disease no blankets, coverings, etc., must
ever be shaken from the windows. They can only be aired within the
room, or rooms, occupied by the patient. Moist sheets hung outside
the door leading to the rest of the house prevent the passage of dust
from the sick-room. It is sufficient to keep them sprinkled with plain
water, as the important thing is the moisture. However, a solution
of carbolic acid may be used. They should be kept wet by some one on
the clean side of the house. Soiled linen from the sick-room should
be placed in a wash-boiler or metal can full of water, never taken to
the laundry in a dry condition. Here also a weak solution of carbolic
acid maybe used, or a very weak solution of soda. However, plain water
will be sufficient. They should be boiled for at least half an hour.
Patients‚Äô dishes and silver should be kept in the room, and before
returning to the house should be boiled.</p>

<p>All cleaning within the patient‚Äôs room during illness should be done
with moist cloths, which should be put into paper bags and burnt.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the room the patient should receive an unusually thorough
bath, hair and all, with tincture of green soap, a dilute alcohol rub,
and finally a sponge-bath of bichlorid of mercury, 1: 2000 to 1:
4000, according to age.</p>

<p>The mode of disinfecting rooms is, generally, to use formaldehyd.</p>

<p>Before setting free formaldehyd in any form the nurse should put on
rubber gloves, glasses, and a thick mouth and nose protector, as
the fumes are very irritating. After leaving the room she should
seal up the door and leave all over night, and then thoroughly air
and house-clean on the morrow. Mattresses and pillows had better be
steam-sterilized if there is any sterilizing plant in the town, or, in
the country, made over and sunned thoroughly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SURGICAL SUPPLIES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class="spa1">TO STERILIZE INSTRUMENTS.</h3>

<p>1. All instruments should be boiled for at least fifteen minutes in a
1 per cent soda solution. <i>Wrap the blades of knives and scissors
in cotton</i>, put them in a separate towel, and in one corner stick
the needles before folding it. Some surgeons prefer to have the latter
simply washed and placed in absolute carbolic acid and then in alcohol
for a few minutes. Water <i>must boil</i> before instruments are put in
and the boiler must be kept closely covered.</p>

<p>2. In a German medical journal, published at Leipsic, Gerson
corroborates his former assertions as to the efficacy of disinfection
of instruments with tincture of soap, citing extensive bacteriologic
tests in evidence. He wraps the blades in Brun‚Äôs cotton, impregnated
with tincture of soap. The cotton protects them from the air and
the tincture is an efficient disinfectant. The instruments are then
ready for use at any moment. After using them he rubs them clean with
cotton moistened with the same tincture, then wraps them in a fresh
piece and lays them aside. No boiling or steaming is required, and the
instruments are not harmed by the process. He recommends this method
especially for military and other practice where steam disinfecting
appliances are not available. He has found that instruments infected
with pus, etc., and not even wiped off after having been used, proved
perfectly sterile after a few days in the wet cotton wrapper. No
colonies developed when they were rubbed on agar plates or soaked in
bouillon.</p>

<p><i>To Arrange Instruments for the Convenience of the
Operator.</i>‚ÄîInstruments for immediate use are laid in trays on a
small movable table on the operator‚Äôs right hand. Instruments that
may not be needed are kept in another tray. A separate tray is used
for suturing material, needles, a pair of sharp-pointed scissors, and
long forceps. Before placing instruments in the tray, dry with sterile towels.

<h3 class="spa1">TO CLEAN INSTRUMENTS.</h3>

<p><i>First of all</i>, the knives, scissors, and needles should be laid
carefully aside and cleaned at once. Scrub all instruments in cold
water to remove blood and pus, then in hot water with plenty of soap.
Rinse thoroughly in hot water, then place in boiling water, take them
out singly and dry; <i>do not drain</i>. Following pus cases all
instruments must be boiled for at least fifteen minutes in 1 per cent.

allow to stand in cold distilled water for 6 hours. Then boil in fresh
water for 30 minutes. Place in absolute alcohol for 48 hours, then in a
solution of Schering‚Äôs celloidin with equal parts of alcohol and ether.
The mixture must stand for 12 hours, or until dissolved; keep tightly
corked. When ready for use add 1 per cent. of sterile oleum ricini, and
immerse thread for 48 hours. Then wind upon a frame to dry. This will
require from 1 to 3 days. When dry, cut into lengths and coil or wind

<h2 class="nobreak">TO PREPARE A PATIENT FOR<br> A SURGICAL OPERATION.</h2>
</div>

<p>The preliminary preparations are of the <i>greatest importance</i>. The
usual standing orders should be followed only when no directions have
been given by the surgeon. When express directions for preparation are
given by the surgeon, the usual standing orders must be disregarded.
Caution in the use of cathartics can not be too strongly emphasized,
for even a simple laxative at such a time may cost the patient‚Äôs life.</p>

<p>The usual standing orders are: For the previous day, liquid diet only.
Give a cathartic, a bath, and a hair-wash during the afternoon, and
flush the bowels thoroughly a few hours later. Surgical preparations
should be completed before retiring time for the night.</p>

<p>Have room and all preparations ready before disturbing patient. Keep
patient covered as much as possible. Protect table with a Kelly pad or
a good substitute for same. Have at hand a drainage-pan and a bucket.</p>

<p>Shave field of operation.</p>

<p>Scrub with tincture of green soap and rinse with sterile water; then
cleanse with ether, followed by alcohol, 70 per cent.</p>

<p>Put on dry sterile dressing (a towel), apply a suitable bandage and
fasten securely.</p>

<p>Douches are given only by direction of the surgeon‚Äîsterile water
preferred.</p>

<p>The final preparation is given in the operating-room a few minutes
before the operation is begun, consisting of a heavy coating of
tincture of iodin, applied by the surgeon in attendance.</p>

<p><b>Morning of Operation.</b>‚ÄîHave a specimen of urine ready for
analysis. No food six hours before operation. If patient cannot urinate
a few minutes before going to the operating-room, catheterize, with
doctor‚Äôs permission. Remove false teeth, jewelry, and protect patient
from the cold.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TO PREPARE A ROOM FOR<br> A MAJOR OPERATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="f110"><span class="smcap">By Eveleen Harrison</span>,<br>
Graduate of the Post-Graduate Hospital,<br> New York.</p>

<p class="center spb1"><i>From the American Journal of Nursing.</i></p>

<p>Of necessity this is far more extensive than the requirement of a minor
operation, and should be commenced the day before if possible.</p>

<p>The selection of the room comes first, and as an abundance of clear
light is more essential than anything else in an operating-room, let
the choice of the room depend on that. When possible avoid using a
room into which the sun will shine directly during the time of the
operation; but in any case, take the room that gives the most light.</p>

<p>When the house is large enough to allow it, and your choice is not
limited, use a room adjoining, or at least on the same floor as the one
to be occupied afterward by the patient, and as near the bath-room as
possible.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to use your patient‚Äôs bedroom, in which case
the bed, after being prepared, should be pushed up in a corner out of
the way.</p>

<p>All the furniture that it is possible to remove is taken out of the
room; any large piece that has to remain should be covered completely
with sheets fresh from the laundry. Carpets and curtains must be
removed, <i>unless the surgeon prefers to have them covered with moist
sheets</i>, and the room thoroughly cleaned, floor scrubbed, windows washed, etc.</p>

<p>As the surgeon will need all the light you can give him, cover only
the lower panes of the window with thin muslin curtains, cheese-cloth,
or‚Äîwhat will answer the purpose equally as well and is ready at
hand‚Äîa thick lather of soap rubbed all over the panes and allowed to dry,
thus shutting off the gaze of outsiders without excluding valuable light.</p>

<p>The temperature should be about 75¬∞ F. and the room well aired
beforehand, as no window will be opened during the operation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>A list of articles usually required for a major operation is as follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Bandages.</li>
<li class="isub2">One strong kitchen table.</li>
<li class="isub2">Four small tables.</li>
<li class="isub2">Three common chairs.</li>
<li class="isub2">One fountain syringe.</li>
<li class="isub2">Three large basins and pitchers.</li>
<li class="isub2">One small basin and pitcher.</li>
<li class="isub2">One piece of rubber sheeting for table.</li>
<li class="isub2">Two slop-jars or foot-tubs.</li>
<li class="isub2">One gallon of hot boiled water.</li>
<li class="isub2">One gallon of cold boiled water,</li>
<li class="isub4">and always keep a kettle of water</li>
<li class="isub4">boiling on the stove.</li>
<li class="isub2">Antiseptic solutions as ordered.</li>
<li class="isub2">Alcohol.</li>
<li class="isub2">Safety-pins.</li>
<li class="isub2">Green or synol soap.</li>
<li class="isub2">Absorbent cotton.</li>
<li class="isub2">Sterilized gauze.</li>
<li class="isub2">New wooden nail-brush.</li>
<li class="isub2">Two dozen towels,</li>
<li class="isub4">and plenty of clean soft cloths.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is an outline of the articles usually required; the surgeon
will supplement what is necessary for each particular operation, but
when a nurse is called upon to prepare for an operation in a private
house, where the conveniences of the hospital are not at hand, she will
be thankful to have ready a list of the things that are indispensable.
I well remember my first operation outside the hospital, and how
difficult I found it to construct a modern operating-room from the
limitations of a small country house.</p>

<p>All supplies, when possible, should be on hand the night before the
operation, and the room cleaned ready for work.</p>

<p>Facing the best light, and about five or six feet from the window,
place the kitchen table, and cover it with a double blanket or
comfortable, rubber sheeting, and a sheet fresh from the laundry, the
whole pinned firmly at the four corners with safety-pins. Lay on the
top a small single sheet, a blanket, and very small, firm pillow.</p>

<p>The little tables are to be arranged around the large one, leaving
plenty of room to walk between. Cover them with sterilized sheets; if
they have polished tops, first put on a piece of oilcloth or rubber
sheeting to prevent damage. These tables are for the instruments,
gauze, sponges, sterilized towels, and basin of solution for the
surgeon‚Äôs hands.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>A strong screw must be fastened in the wall near the window at the
height of about seven feet to support the fountain syringe, which will
be filled with whatever solution the surgeon requires for irrigating
the wound.</p>

<p>One slop-jar stands at the side or end of the large table, the other
beside the table that holds the basin of sponges.</p>

<p>The bureau (covered with a sheet) or the mantle-shelf will serve to
hold the dressings and rubber gloves. A small stand or table will be
needed by the doctor who gives the anesthetic for his hypodermic, clean
towels, and ether or chloroform.</p>

<p>All the basins, towels, and pitchers to be used during the operation
must be thoroughly washed in warm soap suds and then boiled for an
hour, or‚Äîwhen that is not possible‚Äîallowed to stand all morning in
a 1: 1000 bichlorid solution, and then rinsed off with sterilized
water before using. Two of the basins are filled with sterilized water
or salt solution for washing the sponges, another basin holds the wet
sterilized towels, and the fourth the solution for the surgeon‚Äôs hands.</p>

<p>A small bowl is needed for the soft soap to wash off the part of the
body to be operated on, also a small pitcher of 1: 2000 bichlorid and
some alcohol.</p>

<p>In the bath-room arrange plenty of clean towels, a bowl of 1: 2000
bichlorid, and one containing alcohol, synol, or green soap, and a
sterilized nail-brush for the surgeon‚Äôs hands. The surgeon will send
instruments, sutures, and anesthetic.</p>

<p>You cannot err in having ready a good supply of sterilized water, as
an emergency may arise in which a double quantity would be required.
Clean the wash-boiler thoroughly, fill it almost to the top, and boil
for half an hour. One boilerful must be prepared in time for the water
to grow cold before the operation; it is then poured into pitchers that
have been washed in warm soap suds, and rinsed off with the sterilized
water. Cover the pitchers with sterilized towels or napkins.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that everything should be in perfect
readiness when the surgeon arrives. The nurse will do well to go over
the list carefully, so that nothing may be missing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TO PREPARE A ROOM<br> FOR AN OPERATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="f110"><span class="smcap">By Jessie McCallum</span>,</p>

<p class="center">Graduate Johns Hopkins School for Nurses.</p>

<p class="center spb1"><i>From the American Journal of Nursing.</i></p>

<p>1. The room selected for the operation should be near the bath-room, as
a porcelain tub filled with bichlorid solution of the strength of 1:
1000 makes an excellent arrangement for disinfecting the washbowls,
pitchers, platters, plates, etc., which are to be used during the
operation for the solutions, instruments, needles, and ligatures.</p>

<p>2. If the carpet cannot be removed, it may be protected with oilcloth,
rubber sheeting, or newspapers, over which sheets can be pinned.</p>

<p>3. The windows can be frosted by rubbing sapolio on the inner surface,
thus preventing any possible observation from the outside.</p>

<p>4. Two small tables placed together to form one of the required size,
old blankets being used to make the tables of uniform height and also
to furnish a comfortable surface for the patient, can be used for
an operating-table, care being taken to cover the blankets with a
bed-rubber or table oilcloth and a sheet, securely folded under, and
tied to the table with muslin bandages.</p>

<p>5. A Kelly pad can be improvised by tightly rolling a blanket and
covering it with a rubber sheet, two ends of which are to be pinned
together and used to conduct the solutions into the foot-tub below.</p>

<p>6. An ironing-board or the leaf of an extension table, supported by two
chairs, makes a good table for instruments or solution basins.</p>

<p>7. An ordinary clothes-boiler, one-third filled with water, can be
used as a sterilizer, the instruments rolled in gauze, and the brushes
and orange sticks (for the doctor‚Äôs hands) being immersed therein. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
necessary dressings, towels, sheets, fountain syringe, etc., are
sterilized by hanging them in a hammock or sling hung from the handles
of the boiler. A kitchen fork, lengthened by securely fastening to it
an iron spoon, makes a convenient utensil with which to remove the
articles from the boiler.</p>

<p>8. An ordinary sheet folded over at the top makes an excellent gown for
the operator, if the ends be carefully taken up under the arms, crossed
in the back, and used as sleeves for the shoulders and upper part of
the arm, the middle of the upper hem of the sheet being pinned to the
collar in front.</p>

<p>9. Water boiled in the clothes-boiler or tea-kettles can be quickly
cooled by placing pitchers of it, covered with sterile towels or
cloths, in a dish-pan or foot-tub of cracked ice.</p>

<p>10. A kettle of water kept boiling during the operation is a great
convenience.</p>

<p>11. Salt solution filtered into household preserving jars can be
sterilized in the wash-boiler with the other articles.</p>

<p>12. A stretcher can be improvised by slipping two window-poles or
broom-handles into the folds of a sheet folded the proper size and
securely fastened with safety-pins.</p>

<p>13. The Trendelenburg position can be secured by using an ordinary
kitchen chair comfortably padded with a rubber-covered pillow and
sheet, the back of the chair being placed under the patient.</p>

<p>14. The patient can be put in the lithotomy position by placing under
the knees a padded walking-stick, to the ends of which is fastened a
sheet folded diagonally, and passed under the shoulders.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">AN EMERGENCY STEAM STERILIZER.</h3>

<p>Take an ordinary wash-boiler. Make a crate of three light boards and
a few slats to fit the interior. Boards should be about six inches
high, to escape the water. The slats laid across will support all goods
necessary for an operation. Pack parcels lengthwise to permit the full
circulation of steam. Sterilize under full pressure of steam for one
hour. Then take out and place on a table to dry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">TO STERILIZE AN OBSTETRIC SET<br> OR SMALL PACKAGES.</h3>

<p>Use a boiler or small kettle which has two handles. Make a hammock of
strong muslin, tie corners to the handles and place packages in the
sling suspended an inch or two above the boiling water. Cutting the
muslin in a square and folding it on the bias gives more room, as the
goods will stretch.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">PURULENT OPHTHALMIA</h3>
<p class="f120">(SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION<br> OF THE CONJUNCTIVA).</p>

<p class="f110"><span class="smcap">By Cassius D. Wescott, M. D.</span>,</p>

<p class="center spb2">Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at<br>
            Rush Medical College, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>Purulent ophthalmia is caused by a specific germ, and is very
contagious.</p>

<p><i>Local Treatment.</i>‚ÄîIrrigate with warm boric-acid solution or
normal salt solution every hour. Anoint the edges of the lids with
sterile vaselin to permit free drainage. Castor oil and glycerin, of
each, equal parts; or borated vaselin may be used for the same purpose.
Astringents and caustics, silver nitrate, etc., are usually applied by
the doctor.</p>

<p><i>For an anodyne</i>, atropin is principally employed, also cold or
hot compresses; in the use of the latter care must be taken to prevent
irritation of the skin that will show itself in a permanent livid hue.</p>

<p>In case of excessive swelling a leech may be applied, or the doctor may
resort to scarification.</p>

<p><i>Medicines</i> consist of cathartics, diuretics, diaphoretics,
opiates, tonics.</p>

<p><i>General Treatment.</i>‚ÄîFrequent baths, plenty of fresh air.
Temperature of the room should be uniform. Moderate and subdued light.</p>

<p><i>Diet</i> should consist of nutritious food, liquid or soft,
according to the condition of the patient.</p>

<p>The gravity of each case depends largely upon the extent to which the
cornea is involved.</p>

<p>Treatment must, of course, be modified according to the virulence of
the inflammation.</p>

<p><i>To Apply a Leech.</i>‚ÄîLeeches are applied to relieve congestion.
Put one in a small vial with a mouth large enough for the leech to
crawl through. Cleanse the patient‚Äôs temple, and with a sterile needle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
scratch the skin until the blood shows. Directly over this place the
mouth of the vial. The leech will bite almost instantly, and will drop
off when it is gorged. If the occasion requires the leech to be taken
off before it is gorged, sprinkle a little salt on its head. Hemorrhage
should not be checked unless profuse, in which case a piece of ice or
alum applied to the spot will arrest the flow. <i>If possible, the
patient should be kept in ignorance of the application.</i></p>

<h3 class="spa2">OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.</h3>

<p>When the disease develops it will be manifested, as a rule, from three
to five days after birth by redness of the eye and a slight discharge.
It is the duty of the nurse, as well as of the accoucheur, to examine
the eyes of the new-born babe each day during the lying-in period, and
at the first sign of trouble, if discovered by the nurse, the attention
of the physician should be directed to the matter. During the first two
or three days after the disease begins there is usually little or no
pus present, and comparatively little swelling of the lids, except in
the most violent cases. During this so-called first stage the treatment
should be that of an ordinary acute catarrhal conjunctivitis‚Äîviz.:
iced compresses applied for an hour twice a day if the baby is well and
strong; gentle flushing of the conjunctival sac with a warm saturated
solution of boric acid. As soon as pus begins to form, the eyes must be
cleansed more frequently‚Äîevery hour during the day and every two hours
during the night‚Äîand the edges of the lids should be kept constantly
anointed with sterile vaselin to prevent their agglutination and the
retention of the discharge. Drainage is indicated whenever there is
suppuration, and if we can prevent the sticking together of the lids
in this way, we allow free drainage and reduce the irritation which
invariably results from retention of the discharges in these cases.</p>

<p>In all cases it will be noticed that after the discharge has been
washed away from the everted lids there are strings or shreds of mucus
in the folds of the conjunctiva. The nurse should endeavor at each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
cleansing to wash them out by continuous flushing and gentle
manipulation of the lids. If she does not succeed in keeping the eyes
free from these shreds the physician will remove them at least once a day.</p>

<p>If the conjunctiva of the globe becomes swollen and edematous and rolls
up over the edge of the cornea, the nutrition of this precious membrane
becomes threatened, and inflammation of the cornea, with ulceration or
sloughing, is the cause of the blindness which follows this disease. At
the slightest indication of haziness of its surface the iced compresses
should be discontinued and hot fomentations resorted to. They may be
applied every three hours for fifteen minutes each time. Great care
and judgment are necessary in order that the heat be sufficient to be
effective without burning the delicate skin of the lids and that it
be continuous. The compresses should be changed at least every sixty
seconds during their application. When the cornea becomes ulcerated
great care must be used in the manipulation of the lids not to make
pressure upon the eye-ball for fear of causing perforation. If the
lids are slippery from the presence of vaselin or discharge, a single
thickness of gauze or a little cotton held between the finger and the
lid will be found a great help in opening the eye.</p>

<p>As the discharge of pus begins to diminish, which may not be for
several weeks in bad cases, we may somewhat modify our treatment; the
strong applications need not be quite so strong, and the cleansing need
not be quite so frequent; but the most important item in the treatment
of all these cases is the frequent thorough cleansing of the eyes, and
if the cleansing is thoroughly done as above described each hour and
the lids kept constantly anointed, in order to prevent accumulation
of the irritating discharge, more frequent cleansing will not be
necessary. Great care must also be exercised to prevent much crying by
these little patients. They must be kept warm, regularly nursed or fed,
and the slightest derangement of the alimentary canal must be attended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to. If the cause of the crying cannot be ascertained and removed, it
is wiser to soothe the baby with a simple anodyne than to permit the
crying to go on.</p>

<p>It should not be necessary to point out the danger which lies in all
things which come in contact with the discharge from these eyes.</p>

<p>Blennorrhea neonatorum is responsible for at least 25 per cent. of all
the blindness in the world, and yet not one case in a hundred should
result disastrously if skilfully and patiently managed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EMERGENCIES.</h2>
</div>

<h3>HEMORRHAGES.</h3>

<p>Hemorrhage from the arteries may be recognized by its bright red color
and by the spurting jets by which the blood leaves the wound. Venous
(from the veins) hemorrhages flow in a steady stream and are darker in
color. Arterial hemorrhage may be checked by firm pressure over the
side nearest the heart or above the wound. Venous hemorrhages may be
checked by firm pressure on the side distant from the heart or below
the wound. Large veins like the jugular should be compressed both above
and below the wound because the vein may bleed from both ends. If possible,
digital pressure should be made directly over the bleeding point.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage from the <i>leg</i> may be checked by firm pressure upon the
femoral artery, in the middle of the groin at the top of the thigh.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage from the <i>forearm</i> by compression under the inner edge
of the biceps against the humerus.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage from the <i>upper arm</i> by compression of the axillary
artery against the humerus in the axilla.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage from the <i>cheek</i> by compression on the facial artery
against the lower jaw just in front of the masseter muscle.</p>

<p>Flexing the limbs at the joints with a pad between them to make the
compression secure and then binding the part may prove a successful
method of arresting the flow of blood. A constrictor of rubber tubing
twisted firmly around the limb is a ready appliance and a most
successful way of checking a flow of blood from an injured limb. But it
should not remain on longer than absolutely necessary or gangrene may
result from complete stoppage of the circulation.</p>

<p>Wounds should be packed fully and evenly with some absorbent material.
Applications of heat and cold are common methods of checking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
hemorrhages, heat being at all times preferable. Hot water poured on
open wounds will encourage coagulation. Bleeding from an ulcer of the
leg, which often results from varicose veins, should be stopped by firm
pressure over the wound.</p>

<p><i>Hemorrhage from the Lungs.</i>‚ÄîA teaspoonful of salt taken
internally may stop it. Place an ice-bag over the chest. Morphin, gr.
‚Öõ-¬º, may be given under the instructions of a physician. In all cases
put patient in bed and enjoin complete rest until medical aid arrives.</p>

<p><i>Nose-bleed (Epistaxis).</i>‚ÄîFirst of all, position and rest should
be attended to. The patient should not lie down unless very weak. The
higher the head the better. Loosen clothing about the neck and thorax.
Caution patient against coughing or sneezing. Holding the nostril
tightly closed, with cold applications to the back of the neck, is
sometimes successful. Insufflation of ice- or alum-water, or of tannic
acid solution may induce coagulation. Profuse bleeding will require
packing of the nostrils.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">FRACTURES.</h3>

<p><i>Compound Open Fracture.</i>‚ÄîThe bone is broken and the wound
extends from the seat of the fracture to the outside. Such wound may
be caused by the injury itself, or may occur secondarily from the
protrusion of pieces of bone through the skin.</p>

<p><i>A comminuted fracture</i> is one in which the bone is broken into a
number of fragments.</p>

<p><i>An Impacted Fracture.</i>‚ÄîThe broken ends have been forcibly driven
into one another, and are thus fixed.</p>

<p><i>Multiple Fracture.</i>‚ÄîThe bone is fractured at different points,
or when different adjoining bones are broken.</p>

<p><i>A complicated fracture</i> is one associated with a serious injury
to some important adjacent part‚Äî<i>e.g.</i>, a large vessel.</p>

<p><i>A green stick or incomplete fracture</i> occurs where the bone is
soft and bends, and is only partially fractured; it is most frequent in
children.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b> of fractures are usually pain, loss of function,
deformity (seen or felt by passing the fingers over the seat of pain),
crepitus or the grating sound produced and felt on rubbing the broken
ends against each other, abnormal mobility in the course of the bone,
swelling, and discoloration.</p>

<p>The principal point is to keep the part immovable and in a position to
give as little pain as possible. Support the limb with something stiff
and padded with cotton or remnants of yielding material. Bandages can
be made of handkerchiefs, strips of linen, ribbon, etc., to keep the
splint firm.</p>

<p>For the <i>forearm</i> padded splints long enough to take in the hand
from above the elbow should be applied. Tie firmly with bandages and
suspend in a sling.</p>

<p>If the <i>upper</i> arm be fractured, bind it tightly to the side.
For the <i>thigh</i>, the splints should extend from under the arm to
the ankle and should be bound to the body and leg with long towels or
sheets torn into strips. A splint made of blankets, rolled up tightly
from both sides on broomsticks, allowing space for the limb to rest
between the supports, is a good and ready appliance. Always make
extension to prevent contractions of the muscles, as this would result
in shortening the leg.</p>

<p>For a broken <i>clavicle</i> (collar-bone) bind the arm to the chest.
Put the patient on the flat of his back with a small pad between the
shoulder-blades. This will keep the broken ends in a normal position.</p>

<p>N. B.‚ÄîIn every case elevate and support the injured member on a
pillow, keep in position and give complete rest until medical aid
arrives.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">DISLOCATIONS.</h3>

<p>Dislocation is a displacement of the joint. It may occur with a break
of the limb, but usually results from a fall or strain.</p>

<p>There may be deformity and inability to move the injured part.
Sometimes an abnormal projection is the first sign. If inflammation
arises, apply cold applications. The only treatment a nurse may give is
to keep the patient quiet and await skilled help.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">SPRAINS.</h3>

<p>There may be extreme pain, swelling, inflammation, discoloration, and
inability to use the joint. Support and elevation of the limb is of
the greatest importance. Use hot or cold applications to allay the
inflammation and pain. Cover with a thin soft pad, and bandage evenly
and firmly. A sprain should not be neglected, as it may cause future
disease of the injured part.</p>

<p>For recent bruises cold applications are best. Give the patient
complete rest, support and elevate the injured limb, apply cold or hot
applications, and await skilled help.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BURNS AND SCALDS.</h3>

<p>In severe cases the constitutional treatment is of more importance
than the application of local remedies. If the patient is in shock
wrap him in warm blankets, and give him stimulants. In superficial
cases where the skin is not broken powder with bicarbonate of soda
(baking soda). A ready domestic application is sweet oil. <i>Exclude
the air at all times.</i> When vesicles have been produced they should
be punctured with a sharp instrument, and the serum gently evacuated
with absorbent cotton. Apply soothing ointments or wet dressings.
<span class="smcap">In case of severe burns of the body</span> immerse
the patient in a warm bath, keeping it at even temperature. Separating
a layer of common white cotton wadding, and wrapping it about the
injured part will allay the pain, and the cotton has the advantage
of not adhering to the raw surface. Splints and bandages should be
employed to prevent contractions.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BURNS OF THE EYE.</h3>

<p>For burns resulting from molten lead, strong alkalies, lime, or acids,
flush freely with warm water or boric-acid solution, and anoint with
pure vaselin or a few drops of castor oil. Do not rub the injured
tissues. The applications should be made quickly and very gently. Put
on cold compresses until medical aid arrives.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">INJURIES TO THE EYE.</h3>

<p>For surface injuries a drop of castor oil may be applied, and the eye
kept closed for the day with a pad of wadding and a bandage.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">SYNCOPE<br> (FAINTING OR SWOONING).</h3>

<p>Place the patient in a recumbent position. Loosen all clothing,
and dash cold water on the face and chest. Spirits of ammonia or
smelling salts should be used with caution, and not brought too near
the nostrils. The pulse and general appearance will indicate if
condition is serious. Give whisky and strychnin sulphate (¬π/‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ gr.)
hypodermically if necessary.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">HYSTERIA.</h3>

<p>In hysteria the patient may be apparently unconscious; the body is
normal to the touch, the pulse is full and regular, the color is
natural, and if an attempt is made to raise the eyelid it will be met
with resistance. Do not leave the patient alone, but do not disturb her
until she recovers.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">EPILEPSY.</h3>

<p>The attack comes on very suddenly. The patient utters a sharp cry, and
falls to the ground. The muscles are rigid, the eyes staring, and there
may be frothing at the mouth. The muscles soon relax, and there are
twitchings of the whole body. The attack may last only a few minutes.
Place the patient on his back with the head slightly elevated, and
loosen all clothing. Put a wedge between the teeth, give him plenty of
fresh air, and do not attempt to stop the movements.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">DROWNING.</h3>

<p><i>Begin artificial respiration at once</i>, then soon as possible
remove or loosen all clothing about the back, chest, and abdomen. Free
the throat and mouth from mucus and foreign substances. Secure the
tongue with a dry cloth or handkerchief; keep it drawn forward and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
one side, as this opens the windpipe. Then turn the patient face
downward, allowing the abdomen to rest on a roll of goods. Make firm
pressure on the back and on both sides of the thorax to evacuate the
lungs. Envelop the body in warm blankets, apply heat to the feet, and
stimulate with hypodermic of strychnin, whisky, and coffee.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">SUSPENDED ANIMATION FROM NOXIOUS GASES.</h3>

<p>Remove patient at once into the fresh air. Employ artificial
respiration, apply heat, and stimulate hypodermically.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">METHODS OF ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.</h3>

<p><b>Sylvester‚Äôs Method.</b>‚ÄîLay the patient upon his back; kneel above
the head, take firm hold of the arms above the elbow, and move them
horizontally‚Äîfirst away from the body, then over the head until the
hands touch behind; pull them backward for a few seconds. This process
expands the chest cavity, and the lungs are filled with air, inducing
inspiration. Return the arms to the first position, and make strong
pressure on the sides of the chest and epigastrium to expel the air
and effect expiration. Movements should not be too rapid; they should
be repeated about sixteen times a minute. In case of apparent want of
success, persist in the treatment until it has been ascertained that
the heart has ceased to beat.</p>

<p><b>Marshall Hall‚Äôs Method.</b>‚ÄîRoll the patient over on his breast,
make gentle pressure on the back, then turn the body gently but
completely on the side, and again make gentle pressure on the back.
Repeat these movements fifteen times every minute.</p>

<p>Artificial respiration may be kept up for hours before the faintest
symptoms of life are shown.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">SUNSTROKE.</h3>

<p>Two conditions result from exposure to excessive heat: thermic fever
and heat exhaustion.</p>

<p>In <b>thermic fever</b>, after prodromal symptoms consisting of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
headache, nausea, and vomiting, there are stupor or coma, fever ranging
from 105¬∞ to 110¬∞ F., flushing of the face, contraction of the pupils,
a rapid, full pulse, and noisy respirations.</p>

<p><i>Management.</i>‚ÄîPack the patient in ice, and rub with ice.
Ice-water enemas may also be given. Bleeding and the subcutaneous
administration of normal salt solution are sometimes efficacious.</p>

<p>In <b>heat exhaustion</b> consciousness is not lost; the skin is cold
and moist; the respirations are shallow and rapid, but not noisy; and
the pulse is feeble.</p>

<p><i>Management.</i>‚ÄîThe patient should be covered with blankets and
surrounded with hot bottles. Aromatic spirit of ammonia (30 minims),
whisky, and black coffee are useful stimulants.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MASSAGE‚ÄîMECHANO-THERAPY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Massage (meaning to knead or manipulate) is one of the oldest
therapeutic measures employed for the relief of disease. It is probable
that the Chinese used this method of treatment several thousand
years ago. The Japanese and the Greeks and Romans also were ancient
users of massage. To-day it is recognized as one of our most useful
adjuvants in the treatment of a great many disorders. Unfortunately,
like some other therapeutic measures, it has been misused for personal
gain by unscrupulous parties to the great detriment of this form of
treatment; because of this many physicians have hesitated to adopt its
use extensively for fear of being classed with the army of quacks and
charlatans who endeavor to guile the public with a pretended knowledge
of massage. It not being possible for all nurses to become proficient
in the art of massage while doing general nursing (as it requires time,
patience, and a great deal of experience to succeed), massage has
become somewhat specialized, and we find many nurses who devote their
time and attention exclusively to this work. Yet all nurses should have
a general knowledge of the physiologic effects of massage and how to
give it. The best results are obtained only when massage is given under
the direct supervision of a physician, as massage may influence the
function of almost every organ and tissue of the body.</p>

<p>Some general rules may be given as to the hour and duration of each
treatment. A great deal depends upon the nature of the disorder in
each individual case. In the treatment of neurasthenic patients where
insomnia is often a troublesome symptom, massage given one or two hours

before the patient quiets down for the night frequently results
in improved sleep. Again, other patients will do better to have
the treatment one or two hours after the morning meal. Individual
peculiarities must be considered always in giving massage. The room
should be of such temperature that the patient when exposed will not
feel chilly. Absolute quiet should be maintained during the treatment,
and after the treatment the patient should remain quiet in a recumbent
posture for an hour or two as the condition may require. The oft-used
expression ‚Äúthat a masseur or masseuse possesses a great deal of
electricity which is transferred during the treatment to the patient,‚Äù
should find no place in the intelligent mind in considering the effects
of massage. It is true that one operator by his method of administering
massage may please a patient and accomplish more than another, but this
is due only to the fact that one understands how it should be given,
and the other does not.</p>

<p>All the different movements in massage may be classed under the
following: First, stroking; second, friction; third, kneading; fourth,
vibration; fifth, percussion; sixth, joint movements.</p>

<p><b>Stroking.</b>‚ÄîThis procedure may be given with two or three fingers
or the palmar surface of one or both hands. The movement should be
gentle, and the contact made as lightly as possible. Stroking should be
done always in one direction, and, as a rule, in the direction of the
blood currents in the arteries. The physiologic effects when properly
applied should be sedative, as the purpose should be to diminish
the blood-supply to the part. It produces a certain effect upon the
cutaneous nerves which is very quieting. It is often found useful when
applied about the forehead for sleeplessness. Nervous headache may be
relieved by the same procedure. Neuralgic pains and the vague, but
nevertheless uncomfortable, sensations complained of by neurasthenic
patients are often relieved by this measure.</p>

<p><b>Friction.</b>‚ÄîIn this procedure the whole or part of the palmar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
surface of the hand is moved over the surface of the body with
considerable pressure. The principal effect of friction is upon the
superficial blood-vessels and the lymphatics. In the lower extremities
the movement should be from below upward in the direction of the
venous flow. The same may be said of the upper extremities. The thumb
may be made to follow the course of the larger veins, in this manner
stimulating the venous circulation. Some patients object to friction
applied by the dry hand, in which case some lubricant may be used; pure
vaselin, cocoa-butter, and talcum powder are among the best for this
purpose. Friction should always be used in the beginning of massage,
especially if the surface of the body is cold.</p>

<p>It is not the intention here to give minute instruction as to the
methods of procedure with all the different parts of the body; only
general instructions can be here given, and those requiring further
information should consult text-books upon this subject.</p>

<p><i>Physiologic Effects of Friction.</i>‚ÄîFirst, reflex effects
upon the vasomotor nerves producing dilatation of the peripheral
blood-vessels with increased circulation, aiding the venous and
lymphatic circulation. It is useful in all conditions accompanied by
poor peripheral circulation. It not only stimulates the circulation,
but aids materially in elimination and increased nutrition. It aids in
the relief of general dropsy and hastens the absorption of inflammatory
exudates resulting from sprains and various joint affections, etc.</p>

<p><b>Kneading.</b>‚ÄîKneading is one of the most important procedures in
massage. It consists in the alternate compression and relaxation of
the tissues, the hand not being allowed to slip over the surface as
in friction. It may be administered in various ways, such as rolling,
wringing, and the use of the palm or fingers. Furthermore, it may be
deep or superficial. Superficial kneading stimulates all the functions
of the skin, increases superficial circulation in the blood-vessels and
lymphatics. In deep kneading the object is to influence the deep-lying
muscles, and care should be exercised in this procedure not to injure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the large blood-vessels and nerves. Here a knowledge of anatomy is
essential. In the beginning of deep kneading little pressure should be
exercised until tolerance is established; then greater pressure may
be exercised without discomfort to the patient. It is quite essential
that each muscle group be gone over carefully and thoroughly, so that
every muscle so far as possible shall be included in the treatment. The
physiologic effect of deep kneading is a stimulation of the functions
of the nerves, blood-vessels, lymphatics, and cellular metabolism of
the muscles. It is of especial benefit to patients who are unable to
take a sufficient amount of active exercise, such as those suffering
from neurasthenia, rheumatism, chronic neuritis, locomotor ataxia, and
from localized disturbances, such as fractures, sprains, etc.</p>

<p><b>Vibration.</b>‚ÄîThis procedure consists of vibratory movements to
the body of the patient through the hand of the operator. It may be
given by using the palmar surfaces of the hand or the finger-tips.
This procedure stimulates the superficial circulation and acts as
a mild general stimulant. It may be used in conditions of poor
circulation from any cause, but is contraindicated in conditions of
hypersensitiveness.</p>

<p><b>Percussion.</b>‚ÄîThis procedure consists of blows or taps with
varying degrees of force. The tips of the fingers may be used, the two
hands alternating, or the palmar or the ulnar surface of the hands may
be used for the same purpose. In any case, the force should not be
sufficient to bruise the tissues. The physiologic results of percussion
are stimulation for functions of the skin and a marked effect upon
the underlying structures, muscles, nerves, and blood-vessels. It is
useful in such conditions as sciatica, inactivity of the liver, chronic
constipation, poor circulation from various causes, and to produce
reaction after a cold bath, etc.</p>

<p><b>Joint Movements.</b>‚ÄîUnder this procedure we may mention flexion,
extension, abduction, adduction, pronation, supination, circumduction,
and stretching. The movements may be passive or resistive. In passive
movements the exercise is almost entirely confined to the joint, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
patient offering no muscular resistance. With the resistive movements
a certain degree of muscular activity is enforced by the patient,
thus not only exercising the joints, but the muscles connected with
the joints. The physiologic effect of joint movements is to markedly
stimulate all the parts about the joint, and is indicated in various
joint disorders which may have resulted in the lessening of the normal
movements of the part, as in rheumatism, gout, chronic synovitis, and
the stiffness that follows immobilization of the joint in the treatment
of sprains, fractures, etc. Care should be exercised in the beginning
not to use too much force in the manipulation, otherwise the existing
condition may be aggravated, and more harm result than good. Increased
force may be exercised with each treatment, always bearing in mind the
necessities of each case.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ELECTRICITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">By Dr. James C. Gill</span>,</p>

<p class="center spb1">Rush Medical College, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>Electricity is a useful and important therapeutic agent, and an
understanding of its effect when applied to the human body is as
essential as a knowledge of any other therapeutic measure. Too often
the therapeutic use of electricity is committed to those having very
little knowledge of it, and consequently good results are not obtained.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to allow or advise patients to use electricity
themselves; no greater mistake would be made or more harmful results
follow if they were advised to go to the drug store, and help
themselves to any drugs they might choose. Electricity should be
administered by a physician, or under the directions of a physician by
a nurse who has been thoroughly taught its use.</p>

<p>In medicine we have usually considered three different forms of
electricity: First, Galvanism or Chemical Electricity; Second, Faradism
or Induced Electricity; Third, Franklinic or Static Electricity. Now,
we add a fourth and a very important one‚Äînamely, <i>X</i>-ray. A nurse
should have a general knowledge of these different manifestations of
electricity and their effect when applied to the body.</p>

<p>In electricity we have units of measurements as we do in weights
and measures. For instance, the force that drives the current of
electricity along, as we might express it, is called the electromotive
force, and its unit of measurement is a volt. The resistance which
the current must overcome is measured in ohms, and the strength of
the current is measured in amperes, or, as we measure it in medical
electricity, the thousandth part of an ampere, a milliampere.</p>

<p>Galvanic or chemic electricity has certain properties not obtainable in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the other forms. Comparatively speaking, it is a current of
considerable quantity, but low electromotive force. The galvanic
current passes always from the positive to the negative pole. It
possesses the power to decompose various compounds, such as water, the
tissues of the body, etc. This is called the electrolytic action, and
may be used to destroy certain tumors, for the removal of superfluous
hair, etc. Again this current has the power to convey certain
substances in solution into the tissues. This is called cataphoresis,
and is used to produce local anesthesia by the use of cocain applied
to the positive pole. This is one of the best methods we possess of
obtaining local anesthesia.</p>

<p>The effect of iodin may be obtained by the use of a solution of
potassium iodid, and the negative pole may be used to affect local
swellings, etc. Muscular tissue may be made to contract by the
application of the current, either when applied to the motor nerve
supplying the muscle or when applied directly to the muscle. Upon
sensory nerves the positive pole is sedative, and may be used to
relieve pain in cases of neuralgias, etc. The negative pole is
stimulating, and may be used in conditions requiring increased
nutrition, etc.</p>

<p>In using galvanism a good battery and outfit are essential. First, it
is necessary to have a milliampere meter, an instrument to measure
the strength of current used. The quantity of electricity used should
be measured the same as the quantity or dosage of drugs prescribed.
Another essential instrument is the rheostat, by which the current
strength may be gradually increased or decreased without interrupting
the current. The electrodes which are attached to the poles of the
battery may be metal, metal covered with sponge, cotton, etc.,
preferably cotton, which may be renewed with each application, thus
avoiding the possibility of infection, always present in the use of a
sponge-covered electrode, which cannot be changed with each application.</p>

<p>In the use of galvanism we may speak of two different methods. First,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
what is called cerebral galvanism, second general. By experimentation
it has been clearly demonstrated that all the deeper tissues and
organs of the body, such as the brain, spinal cord, liver, etc., may
be influenced by galvanism. In cerebral galvanism the object is to
influence the brain and spinal cord. In applying it to the head, a
sponge or cotton-covered electrode 4-5‚Äù in diameter may be used. The
positive electrode is applied to forehead, the negative at nape of
neck, using a current of 5-10 milliamperes for from five to fifteen
minutes, care being taken not to suddenly make or break the current, as
this would produce a disagreeable shock to the patient. The circulation
of the brain may be affected also by placing an electrode at the nape
of the neck, and a smaller electrode (1-2‚Äù in diameter) passed up and
down along the border of the sternocleidomastoideus muscle, using a
current of 3-5 milliamperes. Galvanism used in this way is beneficial
in such conditions as cerebral anemia, neurasthenia, insomnia, etc. In
applying to the spine, one electrode may be used at the upper and the
other at the lower part of the spine; or a large-sized electrode may
be placed over the abdomen, and the other electrode moved up and down
the spine without breaking or interrupting the current, the strength
of which may be from 10-20 milliamperes, and the duration of each
application varied to suit the condition of the patient. This treatment
is indicated in such disorders as neurasthenia, infantile spinal
paralysis, locomotor ataxia, etc.</p>

<p>General galvanization may be given by placing a large-sized electrode
at the spine, over the abdomen, or at the soles of the feet, the other
electrode, smaller in size, being passed over the entire surface of
the body without interrupting the current, which may be from 5-8
milliamperes. This procedure will stimulate the peripheral circulation,
elimination, and nutrition. The muscles may be exercised by using an
interrupted current of sufficient strength only to cause contraction.
General galvanization is very beneficial in such conditions as
neurasthenia requiring the rest treatment, convalescence from various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
diseases, paralysis, multiple neuritis, etc. In the use of electricity
it should be remembered that patients show idiosyncrasies as in the use
of drugs, so that each case should be given the amount of electricity
best suited to individual peculiarities. Unless this point be kept in
mind, we will be surprised to find at times that the use of electricity
aggravates the patient‚Äôs condition.</p>

<p>Faradism, or the induced current, is characterized by a high
electromotive force and a low amperage or quantity. It is an
interrupted current, and from the secondary coil it is an
alternating current. It cannot be used like the galvanic for
electrolytic-cataphoric purposes. Its effect upon the body is almost
entirely mechanical; also unlike the galvanic, there is practically no
polarity. It cannot be used to affect the deep-lying structures, such
as the brain, spinal cord, etc. The current-strength is not measured by
a milliampere meter. It will produce muscular contraction only through
the motor nerve supplying the muscle. This is a point to be remembered.
Its use is confined largely to exercising muscles and stimulating
peripheral circulation, and is useful in such conditions as paralysis
where the cause of the paralysis is in the brain (because where the
lesion producing the paralysis is in the spinal cord or peripheral
nerves the muscle will not contract when faradism is applied), and
in convalescence and all conditions requiring exercise which cannot
be obtained actively. In applying this form of electricity (if the
object be to stimulate circulation), the strength of the current should
be regulated to suit the feelings of the patient. The technic is
practically the same as described above for general galvanization. If
we wish to exercise the muscle, then that current should be used which
is just strong enough to produce muscular contraction and no stronger,
care being necessary not to over-stimulate and exhaust the muscle.
As a means of muscular exercise only this current is preferable to
galvanism, being easier of application and less likely to produce harm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Franklinic, or static electricity, is seldom administered by a nurse
unless in a hospital or in a physician‚Äôs office. The current is
produced by machines of various makes, such as glass and mica. The
plates vary in diameter from twenty inches to three feet or more, and
in number from two to sixteen or more. Its current then generated is
characterized by an enormously high electromotive force, but a very
minute quantity or amperage. Unlike the other two forms of current
described, its use does not necessitate the removal of clothing. It may
be used by placing the patient on an insulated platform and charging
him with this current of high electromotive force, which very markedly
stimulates circulation; or it may be used by applying or drawing
sparks directly from the patient‚Äôs body, in this manner producing
counterirritation, stimulating circulation, relieving localized
pains, etc. It has been found useful in such conditions as chorea,
neurasthenia, muscular rheumatism, lumbago, chronic inflammation of
nerves, etc.</p>

<p>Nurses probably will never be called upon to use the <i>x</i>-ray, but
this most wonderful manifestation of electro-force has recently taken
a prominent position as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent. Parts of
the human body heretofore only revealed by the use of the knife or post
mortem are now plainly discernible during life through the use of this
force. The field of its therapeutic application is a large one, and
disorders which have been considered incurable or difficult of cure by
other means now yield readily to the <i>x</i>-ray.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Wise Combination of Food.</b>‚ÄîIn order that each meal may be
planned to meet the needs of the body it is necessary that it contain
protein, fat, carbohydrate, mineral matter, and water. Some flavor
foods should enter into each meal.</p>

<p>Flavor is important because it stimulates the appetite and because it
stimulates the flow of digestive fluids and thus aids digestion. Such
foods are only injurious when they are used to excess. In that case the
nerves which control the flow of digestive fluids are overstimulated and
at last become weakened. Avoid the use of too many flavors at one meal.</p>

<p><b>Overuse of Carbohydrates.</b>‚ÄîIf too much sugar and starch are
eaten, fermentation may take place and interfere with digestion. Too
much sugar and starch overworks the liver.</p>

<p>Because sweet foods have the quality of satisfying the appetite very
readily they should not be taken to satisfy hunger, but should rather
be eaten after sufficient body building and body regulating foods have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
been taken to meet the body‚Äôs need for such foods. The custom of
serving the sweet food at the last of the meal is in harmony with this
dietetic principle.</p>

<p>It is important that children should form sane habits of eating sweet
foods. The practice of using large amounts of sugar on cereals, cooked
fruits, and in beverages should be discouraged.</p>

<p>The overuse of sugar irritates the lining of the digestive tract. This
is caused by the abstraction of water from the mucous lining. Sugar is
one-sided in its value, consequently it is much wiser to obtain a high
percentage of heat from foods which serve other purposes as well.</p>

<p><b>Protein Foods.</b>‚ÄîThe first class of foods, the proteins, includes
those which have tissue building for their chief purpose. They are
essential for maintenance and for body growth, as they are the only
source of nitrogen. Therefore they are necessary for the growing child
and for the athlete in the development of strong, vigorous muscles.
The more easily digested protein foods are advised for the tubercular
patient whose muscles and tissues have become debilitated by disease.</p>

<p>Proteins are required by each individual, but in varying amounts, to
suit age, occupation, condition of system, and climate. The value of
a mixed protein diet is urged by the best authorities rather than the
diet which contains but one protein food.</p>

<p><b>Overuse of Protein Foods.</b>‚ÄîIt is true that a high percentage of
illness is caused by an accumulation of wastes in the body. It is also
true that protein foods leave a higher percentage of waste material
in the body than any other class of foods. It follows, then, that an
overuse of protein foods overworks the excretory organs and tends to
weaken them. The weakened excretory organs are unable to take care of
the waste products, and as a result the system is affected by poisonous
wastes which are produced by putrefaction in the intestines. A person
in this condition is more liable to have rheumatism, gout, kidney and
liver diseases than one in normal condition.

<p><b>Use of Eggs.</b>‚ÄîEggs serve as a meat substitute.</p>

<p>Eggs require the addition of carbohydrates and some fruit or vegetables
to form a well-planned meal.</p>

<p><b>Digestibility of Eggs.</b>‚ÄîRaw eggs are more easily digested
when beaten. They are often prescribed when a nutritious, highly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
concentrated diet is desired, and in cases of tuberculosis, some forms
of anemia, and various wasting diseases.</p>

<p><i>Effect of Heat.</i>‚ÄîEgg albumen begins to coagulate at 134¬∞ F. and
becomes jelly-like at 160¬∞ F.</p>

<p><b>Preservation of Eggs.</b>‚Äî1. <i>Water-glass (Sodium
Silicate).</i>‚ÄîNine quarts of boiled water (cooled) to 1 quart of
water-glass. Eggs will keep in this solution three and a half months.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>‚ÄîA good grade of water-glass should be of the consistency
of molasses. If heavier than this the water-glass should be diluted to
the right consistency, as the eggs should sink.</p>

<p>Eggs may be added to the solution from day to day as gathered. Do not
wash. If the nests are clean the eggs will not need washing. Keep in a
stone jar in a cool place just above the freezing-point. Do not use the
solution the second year. The water-glass may be obtained in the dry or
liquid form, and dissolved in either hard or soft water.</p>

<p>2. <i>Lime Solution.</i>‚ÄîPiece of lime size of lemon. Pour 1 gallon of
boiling water over it. Let stand until cold. Add 1¬Ω cups of salt.</p>

<p>3. <i>Paper Wrapping.</i>‚ÄîWrap perfectly fresh eggs in paper and keep
in cool place. This is not as effective as Methods 1 and 2, but keeps
eggs for a short time.</p>

<p><b>Directions.</b>‚ÄîPlace the contents of one of the vials into a
well-cleaned quart bottle. Pour upon it a gill of cool water and shake
the mixture thoroughly. Then add to the mixture a pint of fresh milk
and place the bottle in a vessel containing water as hot as can be
borne by the hand without discomfort. Let it stand, with occasional
shaking, for ten to twenty minutes, or until it has acquired a slightly
bitter taste, when it should be removed from the hot water and placed
upon the ice or in a cool place, to check digestion and keep from
spoiling. If it is not quickly cooled the digestion will continue and
the milk become too bitter to be palatable.</p>

<p>Milk thus peptonized may be sweetened if the patient desires it. It may
also be flavored with wine or rum as desirable.</p>

<p><b>Cold Process.</b>‚ÄîThis consists in adding to the milk the
peptonizing powder as above, using cool water and milk, and then
placing the mixture upon ice without warming it at all.</p>

<p>N. B.‚ÄîIf it be found that the milk ferments after following the above
directions, boil the milk first, let cool, and then peptonize. ‚Äú<i>The
bacteria in uncooked milk cause fermentation when pepsin is added.</i>‚Äù

<p>Shake all well together and stand in a warm place, about 110¬∞ to 115¬∞
F., for three hours, stirring or shaking occasionally, then <i>boil
quickly</i>, strain, or clarify with white of egg in the usual manner;
season to taste.</p>

<p>This final boiling is essential; if omitted, digestion will progress
until the food is spoiled.</p>

<p>For the great majority of cases it is not necessary to strain the
peptonized beef, for the portions remaining undissolved are so softened
under the action of the extractum pancreatis that they are diffused
in an almost impalpable condition‚Äîin a form readily susceptible to
digestion in the body.</p>

<p>Chicken meat, alone or mixed with an equal portion of beef, may be
prepared in the same way.</p>

<p>A cereal gruel of wheat, arrowroot, etc., may be incorporated with the
beef, thus giving a food combination that is often highly desirable.</p>

<p>The gruel is prepared in the usual manner, the dry cereal mixed
perfectly smooth with cold water and cooked slowly in a double boiler
until gelatinized. Four ounces of this gruel may be added to the meat
paste, liquor, water and peptonizing powder as directed above, and the
further details of the process carried out just as with the beef alone.</p>

<p>The extractum pancreatis will at the same time digest both the meat and
starch (of the gruel). The broth with the cereal is more agreeable than
when made of meat alone.</p>

<p>The peptonized beef or peptonized beef and cereal may also be made into
a jelly.

<h3 class="spa2">PEPTONIZED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>To a half-dozen large oysters with their juice add a half-pint of
cold water; heat in a saucepan to boiling, and boil briskly for a few
minutes; pour off the broth and set it aside.</p>

<p>Mince the oysters finely and reduce to a paste with a potato-masher in
a wooden bowl; put in a glass jar with the broth and add:</p>

<p>Let the jar stand in hot water or in a warm place, where the
temperature is not above 115¬∞ F., for an hour and a half. Then pour
into a saucepan, stir in a half-pint of milk and heat slowly to
boiling-point. Season to taste and serve hot.</p>

<p>The boiling is essential‚Äîto prevent further digestion and keep the
broth from spoiling.</p>

<p>If heated gradually the milk will be sufficiently digested before the
mixture boils.</p>

<p>The very small bits of oyster that remain undissolved may be strained
out, or rejected in eating the soup, but are rarely unacceptable to the
stomach.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">GUM ARABIC WATER (ACACIA).</h3>

teaspoonfuls of sugar, a wine-glass of sherry or juice of 1 lemon. Good
for poison cases.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">LIME WATER.</h3>

<p>Into 2 quarts of water place a lump of unslaked lime the size of an
egg. After standing awhile, stir thoroughly and pour off the solution;
add fresh water and keep covered.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">ARROWROOT WATER.</h3>

permissible.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">OATMEAL WATER.</h3>

<p>Teaspoonful of oatmeal to a quart of water. Boil down to a pint; then
strain.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BARLEY WATER.</h3>

<p>Wash in cold water 2 ounces of pearl barley. Boil five minutes; then
drain. Pour on 2 quarts of boiling water and boil down to a quart.
Flavor with thinly cut lemon rind; add sugar to taste. Strain only at
patient‚Äôs request.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">RICE WATER.</h3>

<p>Wash 2 tablespoonfuls of cleaned rice; put in a granite saucepan with a
quart of boiling water; simmer until the rice is softened and partially
dissolved; strain; add salt. May be served either warm or cold.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TOAST WATER.</h3>

<p>Put into a pitcher 3 slices of dark brown toast; pour in a quart of
boiling water and cover closely. When cold strain. Wine and sugar may
be added.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">COFFEE.</h3>

<p>1. Best mixture, 2 parts Java to 1 part Mocha. Grind roasted beans
just before using. Fair strength, 1 tablespoonful of coffee to 1 pint
of water. With the ground coffee, mix white of 1 egg and a little cold
water. Pour over it boiling water; simmer five minutes and steep for
ten minutes.</p>

<p>2. Scald a granite coffee-pot. Mix cup of coffee, 1 egg, half-cup of
cold water; add 6 cups of boiling water and boil three minutes. Remove
to the back of the stove and add a half-cup of cold water. Let settle
for ten minutes.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">WHITE-OF-EGG LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>The <i>New York Medical Journal</i> gives the following directions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
(by R. F. Leftwich) for the preparation of this beverage as a nutritive
drink for febrile disorders: ‚ÄúTwo lemons, the whites of 2 eggs, 1 pint
of boiling water, loaf sugar to taste. The lemons must be peeled twice,
the yellow rind alone being used, while the white layer is rejected.
Place the sliced lemon and the yellow peel in a quart jug with 2 lumps
of sugar; pour on them the boiling water and stir occasionally. When
cooled to about the ordinary temperature of tea, strain off the lemons.
Now insert an egg whisk, and when the lemonade is in full agitation
add slowly the white of the egg and continue the whisking. While still
hot strain through muslin, and serve when cold. The white of the egg
will be found to impart a blandness which makes the addition of sugar
almost unnecessary. This absence of sweetness is greatly appreciated
in pyrexial cases, and has its obvious value for diabetics. For
non-febrile cases with clean tongues more than 2 eggs may be used to
the pint if desired. This drink is contraindicated only in cases of
true Bright‚Äôs disease. It is very useful in the febrile diseases of
childhood. It also possesses antiscorbutic properties which replace
those lost from milk by boiling and sterilization. It is recommended as
part of the diet in typhoid fever, forming a relief from the monotony
of milk, and does not have the constipating and flatus-producing
effects that lie in beaten-up eggs that include the yolk. The author
states that the patient who takes plenty of this lemonade in addition
to 4 pints of milk per day will emerge from the pyrexial period of
typhoid fever in a much stronger condition than without its use.‚Äù</p>

<h3 class="spa2">CREAM LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>Fill bottom of glass with cracked ice. Beat white of 1 egg to stiff
froth, and sugar to taste. To this add juice of 1 lemon, stirring
all the time, and then add one half-cup of cream. This will make 2
glassfuls.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">FLAXSEED LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>Tablespoonful of flaxseed, pint of water. Boil one hour, then add juice
of 1 lemon. Strain, and sweeten to taste.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">MILK LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>Tablespoonful of sugar, juice of 1 lemon, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry,
half-cup of milk, half-cup of water.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">MILK PUNCH.</h3>

<p>Cup of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy. Sweeten to taste. Grated
nutmeg may be added.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">KUMISS.</h3>

<p>Kumiss is an acid effervescing drink; contains a very small proportion
of alcohol. It is much more easily digested than milk. The casein is
so finely divided that lumps cannot be formed in the stomach and it is
easily acted upon by the gastric secretion. In the United States it has
been prepared from cows‚Äô milk to which the ferment is added.</p>

<p>One tablespoonful of sugar in a quart of fresh milk. Dissolve one-fifth
of a small cake of yeast in a little cold water, then stir it into the
milk. Put the mixture into strong patent-stoppered bottles. Shake the
bottles for one minute, then stand them on end in a refrigerator or
other cool place. After three days place the bottles on their sides,
and turn them occasionally. Five days will be required to perfect the
fermentation.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BONNYCLABBER.</h3>

<p>This is sour milk in which the curd and whey are served in the same
dish. Curd, whey, and junket is milk where coagulation has been brought
about by the action of rennet.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">WINE WHEY.</h3>

<p>Put 2 pints of milk into a saucepan, and place on fire. When about to
boil add 2 wineglasses of sherry. Simmer fifteen minutes, skimming off
the curds as they rise. Add a tablespoonful of sherry. Skim again, and
strain through clean linen. If preferred, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon
juice may be used instead of wine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">JUNKET.</h3>

<p>Heat half-pint of fresh milk. Add teaspoonful of essence of pepsin.
Stir enough to mix. Pour into custard cups, and let stand until firm.
Serve plain or powder with sugar or nutmeg.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BEEF TEA.</h3>

<p>Free a pound of lean beef from fat, skin, etc. Chop up fine. Put into
a pint of cold water to digest two hours. Simmer for three hours, but
do not let boil. Make up for water lost by adding cold water. Press and
strain. The best meats for beef-tea are the round and rump. Cold water
draws out the albumin; boiling water coagulates it.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BEEF JUICE.</h3>

<p>Cut thin, juicy meat into pieces one and one-half inches square; broil
one and one-half minutes over a hot fire. Squeeze with a hot lemon
squeezer; season with salt and pepper. May be added to milk or poured
over toast.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BEEF EXTRACT.</h3>

<p>Heat a select piece of round steak so that the juice may be freely
pressed. Cut steak into pieces that will fit into a lemon squeezer, and
squeeze juice into a cup. Set cup in a dish of warm water, which must
not be allowed to boil. Season to taste. May be served on toast.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">CHICKEN AND VEAL EXTRACT.</h3>

<p>Make chicken broth from an old hen and cook down until it jellies.</p>

<p>Cook a neck of veal until broth jellies; cool, and skim off fat. As
needed, use equal parts of each. The nourishment is in the veal and the
chicken gives it flavor.</p>

<p>N. B.‚ÄîThe most delicate stomach can digest this.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">SCRAPED BEEF SANDWICH.</h3>

<p>From a piece of steak scrape all the fiber from the connective tissue
with a knife. Season with salt and pepper. Serve spread between slices
of buttered toast.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">CORNMEAL GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Mix 2 tablespoonfuls of cornmeal, tablespoonful of flour, teaspoonful
of salt, teaspoonful of sugar, into a thin paste with a little cold
water. Add quart of boiling water, and cook three hours. Add cup of
milk, and serve.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">CRACKER GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of cracker crumbs rolled fine, teaspoonful of salt,
teaspoonful of sugar, cup of boiling water, cup of boiling milk. Mix
salt, sugar, and crumbs; add boiling water, then milk; simmer two minutes.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">OATMEAL GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of rolled oats; teaspoonful of salt, teaspoonful of
sugar, cup of boiling milk. Mix oatmeal, sugar, and salt; add boiling

<h2 class="nobreak">FOOD AND NUTRITION IN DISEASE.</h2>
</div>

<p>A physician, writing to the <i>New York Medical Journal</i>, says the
chemical composition of the body is quite similar to the composition
of the foods which nourish it. Protein, fats, carbohydrates, mineral
salts, and water are the compounds we need in our foods, and they
are found in flesh foods and vegetables. Protein, the most important
element, is derived principally from meat, eggs, and milk. It is
also furnished by some vegetables, as beans, peas, and the gluten
of wheat; but in these it is mixed with too much extraneous matter,
as husks, bulbs, woody fiber, etc., to be useful in the diet of
the sick. Extractives, as beef-tea, are included in the nitrogen
compounds, but they neither build tissue nor furnish energy; they
are appetizers and stimulants. Animal and vegetable fats are useful;
these are found in meat, fish, milk, eggs, some cereals, olives,
and nuts. The carbohydrates include sugars, starches, cellulose,
and the fibers of plants. Potatoes, sago, farina, and arrowroot are
rich in them. Fats should be used with caution in disease, because
they retard the formation of hydrochloric acid, which excites the
pancreatic secretion, an important factor in digestion. Man can live
better without a stomach than without a pancreas. Physicians realize
that they must rely on diet rather than drugs to cure indigestion, as
the food varies in its proportion of fat, protein, and carbohydrates;
the digestive juices are poured out or repressed and altered in
strength and quantity.</p>

<p>Milk is not an ideal food for the sick, too large a quantity being
required, and the large curds it forms in the stomach often rendering
digestion difficult. Boiled with rice it forms an excellent diet.</p>

<p>In acute diseases lasting from four to six weeks no great effort should
be made at forced feeding. Thin soups, flooding the stomach with
unnutritious fluids, should be avoided. It is unnatural to take food
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
during physical or mental suffering. Appetite is wanting, and imperfect
assimilation adds to the physician‚Äôs worries and the patient‚Äôs
discomforts. When there is no appetite the digestive juices are absent.
Feed a convalescent when, through conversation about some dainty dish,
interest is aroused and saliva is secreted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OBSTETRICS.</h2>
</div>

<p><b>Puberty.</b>‚ÄîThis is the period of transformation from childhood to
adolescence. There is a marked development of the throat and chest, the
breasts become fuller, more rounded, and there is also an enlargement
of the pelvis. These outward signs are combined with certain internal
changes, affecting especially the ovaries and the uterus, that are
described under the terms of ovulation and menstruation.</p>

<p><b>Ovulation.</b>‚ÄîThe ovaries produce ova that are retained in
cavities termed ovisacs (Graafian follicles), which are scattered
throughout the ovary. Sometimes an ovisac contains more than one ovum,
but usually each ovisac contains but one. When the ovary becomes
functionally active, some of the ovisacs in the deeper part of the
organ increase in size and develop toward the surface. From time
to time one of these ovisacs, having continued to increase in size
so as to form a projection on the surface of the ovary, actually
bursts and sets free an ovum. This frequently occurs in association
with menstruation, but may take place at other periods. While this
development of the ovisac has been taking place there is a special flow
of blood to the pelvic contents, and the fringe-like processes of the
Fallopian tube become more closely applied, so that a cup is formed by
the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube, into which the ovum
drops. Eventually the ovum reaches the cavity of the uterus, and,
unless it becomes fertilized or impregnated, it is in due course cast
off from the uterus in the menstrual discharge and perishes.</p>

<p>When the uterus has become the seat of a fertilized ovum there is no
further ripening of ovisacs. After the escape of an ovum from the
ovisac the follicle is filled with blood, and this takes part in the
formation of a structure known as the corpus luteum, which is formed
within the burst ovisac. The corpus luteum varies in its development
according as the ovum becomes fertilized or not. If pregnancy takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
place it remains to its close, but if the ovum is not fertilized it
disappears in about three months. The ruptured ovisac always contains
the elements of a corpus luteum, but its development depends on
the fate of the ovum. Ovulation has been said to commence before
menstruation; ovisacs may sometimes ripen and burst in childhood.
Conception may take place before menstruation has set in.</p>

<p><b>Menstruation.</b>‚ÄîThe blood is derived from the mucous membrane
of the uterus (endometrium) and not from that of the cervix. The
endometrium becomes swollen and thickened prior to the commencement of
the flow, and the blood-vessels are distended. With the beginning of
the flow this swelling gradually diminishes. A few superficial cells
of the endometrium are usually cast off during menstruation, and this
is regenerated during the interval between the periods. The mucous
membrane of the uterus is thus never at rest until menstruation ceases
for good.</p>

<p><b>Conception.</b>‚ÄîFertilization of the ovum may occur anywhere in its
course from the ovisac to the uterus, but ordinarily it takes place in
the uterus. Certain changes take place in the uterus preparatory to the
arrival of the fertilized ovum. The whole organ enlarges, it contains
more blood than before; the mucous membrane becomes soft, spongy, thickens
greatly, and is thrown into folds which are called the decidua vera.</p>

<p><b>Decidua Vera.</b>‚ÄîThe part of the decidua vera to which the ovum
becomes attached and where the placenta afterward forms is called the
decidua serotina. The presence of the ovum acts as an irritant to the
spot where it lodges, and active growth takes place. At the same time
the ovum burrows into the mucosa and gradually becomes embedded. The
vera closes over the ovum. The decidua vera is a mold of the interior
of the uterus. The external surface is rough where it has been torn
from the underlying tissues of the uterus, and the internal aspect
which is in contact with the ovum is smooth. It is thickest at the
third month; after this time the membrane becomes thinner and thinner,
until by the end of pregnancy it is very thin. It is to a considerable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
extent expelled at labor and forms part of the membranes.</p>

<p><b>Ovum.</b>‚ÄîAs the ovum develops the decidua reflexa expands until it
fills the decidua vera at the end of the second month, and by the end
of the third month it has intimately united with the decidua vera to
form one membrane. Until these two membranes have coalesced the ovum is
not free in the uterine cavity, but is enclosed in the decidua reflexa.</p>

<p><b>Pregnant Uterus.</b>‚ÄîAs pregnancy proceeds the uterus ceases to be
a pelvic organ; it becomes rounded, and after the sixth month gradually
assumes an ovoid shape. At the end of the third month it has reached
to the brim of the pelvis. By the sixth month it is level with the
umbilicus, and by the ninth it has reached to the tip of the sternum.
During the last fortnight the organ sinks a little, and this relieves
to some extent the shortness of breath which has been caused by the
pressure on the diaphragm.</p>

<p><b>Fetal Membranes.</b>‚ÄîInside of the decidual membranes we find
the chorion and amnion. Whereas the decidu√¶ are maternal structures,
the chorion and the amnion are derived from the ovum. The chorion is
the more external of the two fetal membranes; it early surrounds the
ovum and throws out processes (villi) toward the decidua reflexa and
serotina. These processes are at first formed equally all over the
chorion, but those which lie in connection with the decidua serotina
grow more rapidly in size and complexity, and remain to form the main
part of the placenta. The membrane in which the fetus lies is the
amnion. Contained within the amnion is more or less fluid, the liquor
amnii, in which the fetus rests as in a water-bed. It permits free
movements on the part of the fetus and protects it from violence from
the outside; it equalizes the pressure on the uterine walls, preventing
pressure on the cord and placenta; and during labor it assists in the
dilation of the os uteri and lubricates the maternal passages. From it
also the fetus derives its supply of water. Occasionally water may form
between the three membranes, and during labor the chorion may rupture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
and not the amnion, and the waters between them be discharged. In like
manner, water which has formed between the decidua and the chorion
may come away. These, then, are two sources of fluid which may be
discharged from the vagina in labor when the amnion is intact.</p>

<p><b>Umbilical Cord.</b>‚ÄîThe organ by which the fetus is attached to
the uterus is a whitish, glistening structure which springs from the
fetus at the center of the abdomen, and passes to the internal aspect
of the placenta. It contains two arteries and one vein surrounded by
a gelatinous material (Wharton‚Äôs jelly), the whole being covered with
a layer derived from the amnion. The vessels usually run tortuously
in the cord, thus lessening the danger of compression, which might
otherwise occur. This arrangement also tends to regulate and equalize
the circulation of the blood through its vessels.</p>

<p><b>Placenta.</b>‚ÄîThe ‚Äúafter-birth‚Äù is a spongy cavernous organ and has
a circumference of from 20 to 24 inches. It is made up of two elements,
fetal and maternal, chiefly the former. The fetal surface, to which
the umbilical cord is attached, is formed by the amnion. External to
the latter is the chorionic tissue, consisting mainly of finger-like
processes of villi, many of which extend to the decidua. These villi
are mostly vascularized. The vascular villus is made of a capillary
loop, lying embedded in a connective tissue, the blood-vessels being
derived from the umbilical vessels. The villi are surrounded by
maternal blood, which circulates in the intervillous spaces. The
maternal part is represented by the decidua serotina. Its surface is
rough and irregular, being broken up into segments or cotyledons.
It is made of two layers: (<i>a</i>) The deep or spongy layer, and
(<i>b</i>) the compact, or layer to which the villi are attached.
The decidua serotina contains large cavities or sinuses, which are
formed by a dilation of the blood-vessels in the wall of the uterus.
They communicate with the intervillous spaces of the placenta, and it
is through the maternal blood circulating in them that nutriment is
conveyed to the fetus through the medium of the villi. An interchange
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
takes place between the fetal and maternal bloodstreams, though, of
course, there is no direct continuity between them. The placenta thus
has a two-fold function in acting both as an organ of circulation
and of respiration. It is through the walls of the villi that this
interchange of gases and fluids takes place; nourishment and oxygen
passing through them to the fetus, and carbonic-acid gas and waste
materials passing through them to the mother. There is no direct
communication between the fetal and the maternal blood. The placenta,
normally, is attached to the contractile part of the uterus, and on
its separation the blood-vessels are closed by the contractions of the
uterine wall. The placenta may be divided into two or more portions,
or one or more of its cotyledons may be detached from the rest of the
organ and have their own vascular supply. The importance of this lies
in the fact that after the placenta is expelled these isolated masses
may be left and give rise to hemorrhage or blood-poisoning.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY.</h3>

<p><b>Suppression of the Menses.</b>‚ÄîThe cessation of the periods may
be due to other causes, but it is usually the first indication of
pregnancy. Conception may take place and menstruation yet continue. It
usually occurs but once or twice, and then only where conception took
place immediately before an expected period.</p>

<p><b>Morning Sickness.</b>‚ÄîNausea and vomiting continued for any length
of time is almost a certain sign of pregnancy. It may begin as soon as
conception takes place and last for many months; sometimes it may occur
toward the end of pregnancy, or occasionally not at all.</p>

<p><b>Salivation.</b>‚ÄîThe excessive secretion of saliva often accompanies
the morning sickness. The secretion is tenacious and difficult of
expectoration. Heartburn, abnormal appetite, longing or loathing for
particular articles of food, toothache and the like may be present.</p>

<p><b>Quickening.</b>‚ÄîThe first feeling of fetal life felt by the mother
is usually between the fourth and fifth months, but may be experienced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
occasionally as early as the third month, or be deferred until the
sixth. Quickening occurs as soon as the uterus comes in contact with
the abdominal wall. Improper elimination of the bowels, causing
gastro-intestinal trouble, may produce movements not unlike this
indication; therefore, this symptom is not reliable.</p>

<p><b>Enlargement of the Breasts.</b>‚ÄîThe breasts grow larger toward the
end of the second month. In some cases the enlargement is very marked,
but in others there is scarcely any increase in size during the whole
term of pregnancy.</p>

<p><b>Pigmentation.</b>‚ÄîColoring of the skin takes place in different
parts of the body. The face may show brownish spots. The skin darkens
in the axilla and in the areola of the breasts. A dark line presents
itself down the middle of the abdomen. The vagina takes on a violet
tint, the cervix becomes purple, the various colors becoming more
marked with the progress of pregnancy.</p>

<p><b>Changes in the Abdomen.</b>‚ÄîThe abdomen grows larger gradually, and
with it the gait and carriage of the woman change, to counterbalance
the weight of the abdomen. It enlarges symmetrically unless the uterus
is displaced by adhesions, or by a tumor in the uterus or external to
it. The tearing of the under layer of the skin of the abdomen while
distended produces streaks (stria), first pink and then white, which
remain after the form resumes its natural shape; any other enlargement
of the abdomen, especially when caused by a tumor, may produce the
same result. The various conditions mistaken for pregnancy, due to
changes in the abdomen, are fibroid in uterus; metritis; swelling of
the tubes and ovaries, distended bladder, a pendulous belly; excessive
fat; extra-uterine pregnancy; and inflammatory conditions, such as
peritonitis. Pregnancy and any of the conditions named may coexist, and
the former may be overlooked, while the latter is recognized.</p>

<p><b>Fetal Heartbeat.</b>‚ÄîThe heart sounds are generally audible between
the fourth and fifth months. The rate is from 120-140 a minute, being
double that of the mother‚Äôs pulse. About midterm is heard the uterine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
souffle, a blowing sound, quite unlike the fetal heart, and its origin
is the rushing of the blood through the enlarged and twisted arteries.</p>

<p><b>Ballottement.</b>‚ÄîIn normal cases there is no pain on palpation.
The uterine wall varies in consistence, being alternately soft and
firm. The fetal parts may be felt through the abdominal wall in the
late months.</p>

<p><b>Lightening.</b>‚ÄîIn the last two weeks, especially in primipar√¶,
the child‚Äôs head sinks into the pelvis, and its body falls a little
forward. The uterus sinks down and forward with the child. The
waist-line lowers, the stomach region is flatter, the navel more
prominent. The patient breathes easier, but does not walk as well.</p>

<p><b>Duration of Pregnancy.</b>‚ÄîAverage time is 280 days; protracted,
314; a short term about 245 days. There is no positive period.</p>

<p><b>Prediction of the Date of Labor.</b>‚ÄîCount 9 calendar months from
the beginning of the last menstruation and add 7 days. An error of 2 or
3 weeks, however, is possible. (See Table on page 178.)</p>

<p><b>Premonitory Symptoms of Labor.</b>‚Äî(1) <i>Lightening.</i>‚ÄîDropping
may be attended with slight pains similar to labor pains.</p>

<p>(2) <i>False Pains.</i>‚ÄîThese vary in nature and quality. They may
be short and sharp, or long and continuous, or irregular. As a rule,
they are marked by irregularity. They are mostly abdominal, rarely
like true pains beginning in the sacral region and moving around to
the region of the pubes. They may be caused by cramps in the abdominal
wall, intestines, or in the distended bladder. They may be due to old
inflammatory areas within the abdominal and pelvic cavities. They are
frequent in cases in which there is marked bowel irregularity, and
in conditions of over-fatigue. Some authors believe that they may be
produced by irregular contractions of portions of the uterine wall. One
important test is the condition of the uterine body during the pain. If
there is no genuine contraction, the uterus will not become hard when
pain is felt. This indication is not always reliable, however, since
palpation may be unsatisfactory on account of the woman‚Äôs nervousness,
her sensitiveness, or the thickness of the abdominal wall. If the cause
be contractions of the uterus, partial hardening may be felt.

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Explanation.</span>‚ÄîFind in
top line the date of menstruation, the figure below will indicate
the date when confinement may be expected, <i>i.e.</i>, if date of
menstruation is June 1st, confinement may be expected on March 8th, or
one day earlier if leap year. (Dr. <span class="smcap">Ely</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
(3) <i>True Pains.</i>‚ÄîThe contractions of the uterus as they become
stronger, in the great majority of cases, cause the woman pain.
For this reason ‚Äútrue pains‚Äù is used synonymously with ‚Äúuterine
contractions.‚Äù With their appearance the woman becomes restless, likes
to sit down, to bend forward and to press on the sacrum. ‚ÄúTrue pains‚Äù
are felt in the sacral region, gradually moving around toward the
pubes. They begin slowly, increase in intensity, and slowly pass away.
The pains are involuntary, and the woman tries to complain or cry out.
Differences in this largely depend upon the nervous temperament of the
patient, though they are also related to variations in the physical
factors. ‚ÄúTrue pains‚Äù must be distinguished from ‚Äúfalse pains.‚Äù</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Show.</i>‚ÄîWithin twenty-four hours before labor really
begins there is a discharge from the vagina of thick mucus, more or
less stained with blood. This is called the ‚Äúshow,‚Äù and is the plug of
mucus which fills the cervical canal during pregnancy. Sometimes the
show is absent or appears after labor has been in progress for awhile.
If there is much pure blood with the discharge it is unusual, and the
physician should be notified.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">LABOR.</h3>

<p><b>First Stage.</b>‚ÄîThe first stage extends from the time of the labor
pains to the complete dilatation of the os uteri. It may come on very
slowly or act quickly. Slow dilatation occurs normally in a woman over
thirty years of age; and it may be due to inflammatory conditions or
appear in cases where the membranes lining the uterus are adherent. On
examining the vagina there is found a bulging (which is a main factor
in dilatation of the cervix) and a discharge of mucus tinged with
blood. The dilatation increases until it is 4 in. across, and the bag
of membranes bulges like a saucer. In abnormal cases it comes down into
the vagina in the shape of a tube. When the os is fully dilated the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
membranes rupture, a rush of water escapes down the vagina, and the
first stage of labor is ended. Not all of the water comes away, for the
head comes down and acts as a plug. It is very important for the nurse
to recognize the true rupture and not mistake it for incontinence of urine.</p>

<p><b>Second Stage.</b>‚ÄîThis comprises the period from the time of
complete dilatation of the cervix to the end of the expulsion of the
child. The patient has some relief after the first stage, and when the
second stage comes on she holds her breath and contracts the abdominal
muscles as much as she can in making expulsive efforts. The pains
become of longer duration and more frequent; and upon examining the
vagina the head is found down, the tissues bulge, the rectum becomes
stretched, the majora and minora separate, and then, while the pain
is on, there is some change in the position of the head as it recedes
and advances again. Nature brings it slowly, for if the head plunged
down it might produce complete laceration of the perineum. If the head
is delayed too long there is swelling of the scalp. The most painful
period is when the head passes the perineum. Then there comes a marked
change in the position of the fetus, and it lies in that position for
some time; following, comes a rotation to one side, the shoulders turn,
and birth occurs. The cord is still in the vagina, and the third stage
begins with a flushing of amnii fluid. The placenta is still in place
in the uterus. The child may cry, and the pulsation may continue in
the cord for as long as fifteen minutes, but ordinarily for about five
minutes, while a new circulation is established in the infant and more
blood is drawn from the placenta.</p>

<p><b>Third Stage.</b>‚ÄîThe patient has a rest for some minutes. Then the
contractions of the uterus continue until the membranes and placenta
are expelled. The pains begin again; the uterus is smaller, firm,
yet will recoil; it is rounded, and the fundus lies even with the
umbilicus. If the fundus is above the umbilicus something is wrong.
Painful contractions of the uterus follow and cause a squeezing off of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the placenta. There is a flow of blood, the placenta follows, passes
out of the vagina, dragging the membranes after it. The fundus sinks,
and the uterus, hard, contracted and firm, lies in the pelvis. In some
cases it becomes soft, rises up and then relaxes. If it becomes too
soft, the relaxation which follows may induce hemorrhage. The uterus
should be carefully massaged until it hardens.</p>

<p><b>Period of Labor.</b>‚ÄîFourteen hours is a normal range. First stage
usually lasts about twelve hours; second stage about one hour, and the
third stage from fifteen to thirty minutes.</p>

<p><b>Complications of Labor.</b>‚ÄîLabor may be brought on by extreme
mental anxiety. The child may be born without any actual pain. It
may be expelled while the patient has an evacuation of the bowels,
especially if the bowel movement has been induced by enemata or a
purgative. Children may be born without the usual progression of labor,
yet with all normal conditions present. In cases where the mother dies
during labor the uterus continues to contract until the child is born
about fifteen minutes later. The child in such cases is sometimes saved
by a Cesarean section.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">CARE OF THE OBSTETRIC PATIENT.</h3>

<p><b>Diet.</b>‚ÄîDiet should be regulated and consist of light, nutritious
and predigested foods. Milk should be prepared in various ways
palatable to the patient. Wine and fruits and vegetables in season may
be included. For malnutritious patients, malt and beef extracts may be
added. Starches prepared in fat, and rich pastries should be avoided.</p>

<p><b>Elimination.</b>‚ÄîThe bowels must move regularly, and laxatives may
be given if necessary. Alkalies should be given before bedtime, and
effervescent powders in the morning. Enemata should not be resorted to
unless absolutely necessary, as the sudden expulsion of the contents
may produce abortion. The kidneys may be regulated by giving simple
diuretics; plenty of pure water is the best. The condition of the
kidneys is a most important factor in pregnancy. The urine should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
clear and of sufficient quantity. Meats should be eaten but sparingly,
as they over-produce albumin.</p>

<p><b>Baths.</b>‚ÄîDaily bathing in tepid water is very essential to
encourage the elimination through the skin and to promote cleanliness.
A cold sponge is stimulating and very agreeable to some patients.</p>

<p><b>Exercise.</b>‚ÄîExercise should be moderate. Light work about
the home may be encouraged, care being had to avoid over-lifting,
over-reaching, etc. Walking should be insisted upon, to maintain
correct carriage and posture of the body. Outdoor enjoyments may be
had if indulged in with discretion. Tiredness may be overcome by the
patient lying down on an incline, the head lower than the body, thereby
relieving all tension of the muscles and nerves. Any recumbent position
for comfort is beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Breasts and Nipples.</b>‚ÄîPlenty of room should be given to permit
full growth and to encourage the nipples to prominence. Their inversion
or depression may be remedied by massage and manipulation. No alcohol
or other strongly astringent washes should be used. The nipples must
not be hardened, but should be kept soft and pliable; cocoa-butter or
other healing ointments may be applied. Cracks and fissures not only
render nursing difficult or impossible, but may lead to mastitis and
subsequent abscess formations. There should be perfect cleanliness, to
promote pure secretion and prevent sepsis.</p>

<p><b>Pelvic Organs.</b>‚ÄîPelvic organs do not, under normal conditions,
require douches. The normal vagina cleanses itself, and a hot douche
may induce abortion.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">LYING-IN PERIOD.</h3>

<p><b>Confinement Room.</b>‚ÄîA quiet room should be selected, in which
there has been no recent sickness and which is not in proximity to any
sewerage. The room should be well ventilated, with no draughts, and at
a temperature from 65¬∞-75¬∞ F. The furnishings should be plain and few
as possible. They should consist of a table or two, a few chairs, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
narrow iron bed of medium height. If the bedspring is soft, a few
boards may be placed under it to make it firm. If the patient is to
be delivered in bed, it should be made up as follows: (1) Long rubber
sheet; (2) long muslin sheet; (3) rubber draw-sheet; (4) muslin
draw-sheet; (5) a large pad, 3 ft. square and 3 in. thick. All sheets
should be fastened with large safety-pins, and the pad left free to
draw the patient to either side, if the bed is of the low-and-wide
variety commonly used in many homes. The ideal way is to deliver the
patient on a settee, or on two tables, covered with a small mattress;
the physicians and nurses have less work to do and they work to a
better advantage. Moreover, when the patient is carried from the table
to her clean, warm bed she gets immediate comfort and avoids the usual
disturbance and uncleanliness attending the clearing away of soiled
linen, etc.</p>

<p><b>Preparatory Treatment for Patient.</b>‚ÄîThe patient should have a
warm bath, and the genitals should be scrubbed thoroughly with soap
and water. Shaving the parts is much to be desired if the patient has
no objection, then an antiseptic pad should be applied. The nurse must
be sure the bladder is empty; it is very important that a dribbling
from an over-distended bladder should not be mistaken for frequent
urinations; this is to prevent the danger of ruptured bladder from the
constant pressure of a contracting uterus; also a distended bladder
makes labor hard by interfering with the passage of the head.</p>

<p><b>During the First Stage.</b>‚ÄîThe patient may be out of bed and
encouraged to take exercise. She should not walk about too freely
before the head is engaged, lest this induce a malpresentation or
malposition. The patient‚Äôs crying should not be prevented, and she
should be told not to press down. She may have a cup of hot water or
tea, but no stimulant, as an anesthetic may become necessary.</p>

<p><b>During the Second Stage.</b>‚ÄîAll clothing should be removed but the
night-dress. Pin the gown up under the arm, put on perineal drawers,
and a sheet around the body, then place the patient in bed. The pain in
the back may be relieved by pressure over the sacrum, and the patient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
should be encouraged to hold her breath. The nurse should now use
tact to quiet the patient, having hitherto managed, if possible, to
encourage calmness. For cramps in the limbs, the muscles may be moved
and firm pressure applied. A handkerchief bound tightly around the
affected part may relieve it. A sheet may be tied to either side of the
bed, for the patient to grasp, and a block placed at the foot of the
bed for a brace for her feet.</p>

<p><b>Patient After Labor.</b>‚ÄîThe soiled skin should be gently and
quickly bathed with warm solution, the vulva and perineum carefully
cleansed and an antiseptic pad applied. The binder should be pinned
firmly about and below the hips, allowing freedom over the upper part
of the abdomen. If there is any anxiety that the uterus may relax after
kneading it, a tightly folded towel may be placed over the fundus, and
kept in position by the binder. A vaginal douche is never given without
orders from the physician. External douches of lysol, 1 or 2 per cent.,
are given three or four times daily until the lochia becomes scant.
The patient should be watched during the first few hours for symptoms
of hemorrhage. The room should be kept quiet and dark, and light, warm
covering be used on the bed. The patient may have a cup of hot water or
milk to induce sleep and relieve thirst.</p>

<p><b>Diet.</b>‚ÄîDuring the first twelve hours the patient should be kept
on liquid diet. On the second day, butter toast, milk toast, oyster
stew, and chocolate may be added. On the third day, if the bowels move
freely, soups, with rice or barley, and cereal foods may be given.
Stewed fruits (omitting those strongly acid) may be included. After the
fourth day, fresh fish, a chop, chicken, and pigeon may be given. Even
after ordinary diet is ordered, heavy meats and rich pastry should be
avoided for a while.</p>

<p><b>Bowels.</b>‚ÄîThe bowels are usually constipated for the first few
days. A dose of castor oil may be given, to be followed in six hours
by a saline enema. The patient should be encouraged to drink freely of
pure water, to secure proper elimination of the kidneys. If the patient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
can not urinate, after the different methods to produce urination have
been tried, she may be catheterized. The urine should be measured for
some days to ascertain if the quantity is sufficient.</p>

<p><b>Colostrum.</b>‚ÄîThe first secretion in the breasts contains no
nourishment, but is a laxative for the child. The baby should be put to
the nipple as soon as the mother has had some sleep and feels rested.
Nursing assists the uterine contractions, preventing hemorrhage from
the torn placental vessels and cleansing the organs from secretions
still being discharged at intervals.</p>

<p><b>Breast and Nipples.</b>‚ÄîThe nipples should be cleansed after each
nursing with warm boric solution. If they are cracked and sore a
lubricating ointment should be applied and a nipple shield should be
used. If the breasts become distended they should be massaged gently
every two or three hours, and they may be pumped if necessary. In this
state the patient must not have regular liquid diet, and the bowels
must be kept freely open with saline laxatives. A compressed binder
is comforting and beneficial. If the child, for some reason, does not
nurse, the secretion may be dried by an application of belladonna in
the form of a plaster, permitting the nipples to protrude through an
opening cut into the center of it. The belladonna ointment is good but
very unclean. Atropin may be given internally.</p>

<p><b>Conditions During which the Child Should Not Nurse.</b>‚ÄîDepressed
or cracked nipples; inflammation of the breasts; poor health of the
mother; marked anemia; kidney or heart disease; nervous or general
febrile afflictions; tuberculosis; syphilis.</p>

<p><i>Menstruation.</i>‚ÄîIf the return flow of the menses occur during the
nursing period the milk becomes impure, and the child may suffer from
the effects of it. If menstruation takes place normally and the child
does not become ill, it is because the mother is strong and can endure
the drain upon her system with no other bad result than losing flesh.
In such a case it is best to wean the baby, especially after it is nine
months old.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<h3 class="spa2">CARE OF THE BABY.</h3>

<p><b>Upon Birth.</b>‚ÄîAs soon as the eyes are cared for, by flushing them
with warm boric solution (the physician may use Cred√©‚Äôs method‚Äî1 to 2
per cent. nitrate of silver solution, followed by weak salt solution),
the baby should be wrapped in a warm, soft, sterile cloth (cotton
flannel), and placed in a warm crib until the mother has been attended
to. After that the baby should be anointed with warm olive oil,
especially in the groin, axilla, in the folds of the neck and behind
the ears. The nurse should then wash and sterilize her hands to dress
the cord. Apply alcohol, 95 per cent., and then boric acid powder or
any other antiseptic dressing the physician may order; it may be kept
in place by a thin flannel binder, going around the abdomen but once
and be fastened in the back (not too tightly) by sewing it together.
Pins of any kind should be used only where absolutely necessary. The
baby should be dressed in as few garments as possible.</p>

<p><b>Bathing.</b>‚ÄîUntil the umbilicus is healed the child should not be
put in the full bath. The face, hands, and head may be sponged daily
with tepid water. Gently massaging the body every day with warm olive
oil, and rubbing with a soft towel, will not only keep the baby clean,
but prove beneficial. The genitals should be washed well once daily
and sponged after each evacuation of the bowels. During the first few
weeks a little oil rubbed into the parts is better than powder; in most
cases powder will dry the skin too quickly and rub off the delicate
epithelium.</p>

<p><b>General Care of the Baby.</b>‚ÄîThe eyes, the mouth, and navel should
be given the usual daily attention. The bowels, if constipated, should
be encouraged by small doses of castor oil given with a medicine
dropper. If the urinations are not clear and of sufficient quantity the
baby may have warm water, about 1 oz. at a time, three or four times
daily. Leave the infant with the mother <i>only</i> during the nursing
period.</p>

<p><b>Nursing the Baby.</b>‚ÄîPractical experience is daily upsetting
the theory that a set of rules and regulations can be laid down and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
followed for the nursing of all babies; that nursing must be done at
certain hours and after certain intervals. While babies are alike in
nearly every respect, speaking physiologically, there are only a few
who can be awakened at regular intervals to be nursed by the mother or
fed by the bottle. Some babies can not be awakened sufficiently for
nursing, even after four or five hours‚Äô sleep. Others will nurse for
twenty minutes (the rules say it should not be longer than ten minutes)
at two- or three-hour intervals during the day and then sleep all night.</p>

<p>Of course, where the child can be fed regularly, this helps the mother
to regulate her own habits, and is comforting to all concerned.
Therefore, nurses should not lack in determination to encourage such
a system. But no such regularity should be insisted upon where both
baby and mother suffer during the interval when nursing is denied;
the former, hungry and crying lustily, and the mother under a nervous
strain that is harmful to both. Let there be no hard-and-fast rules.
Babies who feed as often as they feel like it (being allowed proper,
though not necessarily long, intervals for digestion) generally suffer
no ill effects and are healthy and strong. Mother‚Äôs milk, the natural
feeding, should always be given, rather than any artificial food, when
the supply is sufficient and good.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FETAL CIRCULATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120"><i>From Kimber‚Äôs Anatomy.</i></p>

<p>The peculiarities of the fetal circulation, leaving details aside,
are: the direct communication between the two auricles of the heart,
through an opening called the foramen ovale; the communication between
the pulmonary artery and descending portion of the arch of the aorta,
by means of a tube called the ductus arteriosus; and the communication
between the placenta and the fetus, by means of the umbilical cord.</p>

<p>The arterial blood for the nutrition of the fetus is carried from the
placenta along the umbilical cord by the umbilical vein. Entering the
fetus at the umbilicus, the blood passes upward to the liver and is
conveyed into the inferior vena cava in two different ways. The larger
quantity first enters the liver, and, alone or in conjunction with the
blood from the portal vein, ramifies through the liver before entering
the inferior vena cava, by means of the hepatic veins. The smaller
quantity of blood passes directly from the umbilical vein into the
inferior vena cava, by a tube called the ductus venosus.</p>

<p>In the inferior vena cava the blood from the placenta becomes mixed
with the blood returning from the lower extremities of the fetus. It
enters the right auricle and, guided by a valve‚Äîthe Eustachian valve,
passes through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. In the left
auricle it unites with a small quantity of blood returned from the
lungs by the pulmonary veins. From the left auricle the blood passes
into the left ventricle and is distributed by the aorta almost entirely
to the upper extremities by the superior vena cava, the blood enters
the right auricle, and, passing over the Eustachian valve, descends
into the right ventricle, and from the right ventricle into the
pulmonary artery. As the lungs in the fetus are solid, they require
very little blood, and the greater part of the blood passes through
the ductus arteriosus into the descending aorta, where, mixing with
the blood delivered to the aorta by the left ventricle, it descends to
supply the lower extremities of the fetus, the chief portions of this blood,
however, being carried back to the placenta by the two umbilical arteries.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
From this description of the fetal circulation it will be seen:</p>

<p>1. That the placenta serves the double purpose of a respiratory and
nutritive organ, receiving the venous blood from the fetus, and
returning it again charged with oxygen and additional nutritive
material.</p>

<p>2. That the greater part of the blood traverses the liver before
entering the inferior vena cava; hence the large size of this organ at
birth.</p>

<p>3. That the blood from the placenta passes almost directly into the
arch of the aorta and is distributed by its branches to the head and
upper extremities; hence the large size and perfect development of
those parts at birth.</p>

<p>4. That the blood in the descending aorta is chiefly derived from that
which has already circulated in the upper extremities and, mixed with
only a small quantity from the left ventricle, is distributed to the
lower extremities; hence the small size and imperfect development of
these parts at birth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NURSING IN DISEASES<br> OF CHILDREN.</h2>
</div>

<p><b>Spasmodic Croup.</b>‚ÄîSpasmodic croup is due to a sudden closure of
the glottis.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>‚ÄîExposure to a cold, damp atmosphere, indigestion, or
irritation of the throat. There may be some hoarseness a few hours
preceding the attack and the child awakens suddenly in the paroxysm of
the sharp croup cough, experiences difficulty in breathing and has the
cyanotic appearance so terrifying to the mother, but which need give no
cause for serious alarm.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>‚ÄîApply hot compresses about the throat. If the attack
is severe give an emetic‚Äîone dram of salt or mustard in one-half cup
of warm water, and repeat in twenty minutes if necessary; an enema of
warm water should be given and steam inhalation resorted to. Keep the
child in an even temperature, restrict diet for a few days, and keep
bowels active.</p>

<p><b>Parotitis (Mumps).</b>‚ÄîAn infectious disease characterized by
inflammation of the parotid glands. Incubation is from two to three
weeks.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>‚ÄîThe disease comes on with a mild chill, pain below
the ear and swelling of the glands. There is great discomfort and the
tension is very disagreeable.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>‚ÄîKeep patient in bed during the height of the
disease. Give liquid and soft diet. Bowels should be opened freely. No
medicine is required unless fever is high. Apply cold compresses to
the affected part, though, if preferred, hot ones may be used. A pad
of cotton with oiled silk is the best application. In cases of extreme
redness or tenderness of the glands, leeches may be applied. In cases
of delirium use the ice-cap. For orchitis, lubricate the parts with
camphorated oil and support with a soft cotton pad.</p>

<p>Duration of disease, from seven to ten days.</p>

<p><b>Whooping-Cough.</b>‚ÄîAn infectious disease, beginning with catarrh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
of the air-passages, like an ordinary cold. The short expiratory coughs
following each other in rapid succession and the period of drawing a
long breath give rise to the whoop characterizing pertussis.</p>

<p><i>Incubation.</i>‚ÄîA week to ten days.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>‚ÄîIsolate patient and if attack is severe put him
in bed. Fresh air is the most essential element. If the cough is
distressing, ipecacuanha wine and paregoric may be given. During
convalescence the child should be watched carefully, as at this period
bronchopneumonia and tuberculosis are apt to develop. Change of air
is advisable. Tonics and cod-liver oil should be employed. The diet
should be easily digestible, nourishing food. After each paroxysm and
after the child has recovered from the exhaustion it produces give
nourishment. There will be a partial if not complete absorption of the
food before another attack. Duration of the disease from six to twelve
weeks.</p>

<p><b>Colic.</b>‚Äî<i>Causes.</i>‚ÄîConstipation, indigestible foods,
flatus, overfeeding, improper foods and exposure to cold.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>‚ÄîChild cries out very suddenly and sharply. There is
a convulsive movement of the extremities, the hands are tightly closed,
abdomen is tense.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>‚ÄîGentle pressure and massage with warm oil over the
abdomen and a few doses of hot or peppermint water will expel the gas.
Burnt brandy is good. The simple warm enema is a common remedy. Wrap
warm flannels around the lower parts of the body and keep the hands warm.</p>

<p><b>Diarrhea.</b>‚ÄîFrequent loose evacuations without tenesmus.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>‚ÄîImpure water or food; irritating secretions poured into
the bowels; bottled milk.</p>

<p>Diet should be restricted to cereal and albumin water. Flush the bowels
very gently with warm water.</p>

<p><b>Dysentery.</b>‚Äî<i>Symptoms.</i>‚ÄîFever, tenesmus and frequent small
mucous, bloody stools. Treat as diarrhea. Keep child warm, especially
about the abdomen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p><b>Cholera Infantum (Summer Complaint).</b>‚Äî<i>Symptoms.</i>‚ÄîFever,
intense thirst, continuous vomiting, and purging of the bowels. Stools
soon become watery and pale-green in color, and the child has all
appearances of complete prostration.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>‚ÄîStomach washing and intestinal irrigation carefully
given. Restrict diet to barley water containing a few drops of brandy
and give hourly for a few days.</p>

<p><b>Rickets.</b>‚ÄîA disease of infants, characterized by impaired
nutrition of the entire body and alteration of growing bones.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>‚ÄîNot positively known. Heredity may be a predisposing
factor. Another theory given is want of sunlight, impure air, prolonged
lactation, and suckling. As it is a constitutional disease it is almost
certain to be due to a disturbance of nutrition. <i>It is much less
found in the breast-fed than in the artificially fed and more common
when the artificial feeding is bad than when it is properly given.</i></p>

<p><b>Scurvy</b> is a constitutional disease of metabolism <i>due to
a faulty diet</i>. Probably the absence of some constituents in
the nature of vitamins. <i>Scurvy and rickets are two distinct
diseases</i>, and yet both may be due to <i>impure, improper infant
feedings</i>.</p>

<p><i>Three General Symptoms of Great Importance.</i>‚ÄîFirst, a diffuse
soreness of the body, so that the child cries when an attempt is made
to move it; second, slight fever; third, profuse sweating. Deformities
may often be prevented if, in the early stages, constant care is taken
that the child is properly held.</p>

<p><b>Thrush.</b>‚Äî<i>Aphth√¶.</i>‚ÄîSmall white, furry mouth ulcers
developing during the first and second year of infancy.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i>‚ÄîLack of cleanliness in the care of the mouth, especially
after feeding with bottled milk. The patches are tenacious, grow
larger, until sometimes they involve the entire gastro-intestinal
tract, resulting in acute indigestion and bowel disorders.</p>

<p>The first symptom is usually some evidence of painful distress in the
infant‚Äôs efforts to nurse; fever, diarrhea and vomiting occur and the
trouble may become acute.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>‚ÄîAbsolute sterile cleanliness in the preparation and
administering of the patient‚Äôs food. The mouth must be cleansed with
warm boric acid solution after every feeding. The patches should be
touched gently with the same solution, and the lips anointed with a
soothing lotion.</p>

<p><b>Convulsions.</b>‚ÄîThe principal predisposing causes are infancy
conditions affecting the nutrition of the brain and hereditary
influences. The brain grows more during the first year than in
later life, and this rapidity of growth is in itself an important
predisposing cause of functional derangement. After infancy attacks
of convulsions are much less frequent, and after seven years they are
relatively rare. Death may take place from a single attack in very
young infants, especially those who are rachitic.</p>

<p>Convulsions may be thought to indicate the onset of some acute disease
when they occur in a child over two years old, and when they come on
suddenly or with only slight premonition in a child previously well;
but the most important point is that they are accompanied by a high
temperature‚Äî104¬∞-106¬∞ F. Acute meningitis is the only other condition
likely to produce these symptoms. Whether the convulsions mark the
onset of lobar pneumonia, scarlet fever, malaria, or some other disease
can be determined only by carefully watching the patient‚Äôs symptoms for
24 or 36 hours.</p>

<p>In convulsions depending upon some disorder of the alimentary tract,
we may get a history of chronic constipation or improper feeding,
and in nursing infants, sometimes of passion or intoxication in the
wet-nurse. Convulsions are so frequently due to digestive derangement
that the condition of these organs should be one of the first things
to be looked into. Examination of the urine should never be omitted
in any case of convulsions of doubtful origin, even where no dropsy
is present. This, both in infants and older children, is too often
overlooked. In all cases of convulsions of doubtful or obscure origin
occurring in infants, rickets should be suspected as the underlying cause,
and the child carefully examined for other evidences of that disease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>‚ÄîCold should be applied to the head, best by means of
an ice-cap or cold cloths, and dry heat and counterirritation to the
surface of the body and extremities.</p>

<p><i>The Mustard Pack.</i>‚ÄîThe child is stripped and laid upon a
blanket, and the trunk is surrounded by a large towel or sheet
saturated with mustard water. This is made as follows: 1 tablespoonful
of mustard, 1 quart of water. In this the towel is dipped and, while
dripping, wound around the entire body. The patient should then be
rolled in the blanket. This pack may be continued for 10 or 15 minutes;
at the end of which time there will usually be a very decided redness
of the whole body. It may be repeated, according to indications.
Where it is desired to produce general counterirritation, the mustard
pack is not quite as efficient as the mustard bath, but it has the
advantage in causing much less disturbance to the patient. The mustard
pack is useful in the conditions of collapse, or of great prostration
from any cause whatever, in convulsions, and in cerebral or pulmonary
congestion. The degree to which the counterirritant of the skin
should be carried will depend upon the condition of the pulse and the
cyanosis. The feet may be placed in mustard water while the child lies
in its crib (Holt).</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A FEW NOTES ON MEDICAL DISEASES.</h2>
</div>

<h3>RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>A constitutional disease, characterized by fever, inflammation in and
around the joints, occurring in succession, and a great tendency to
induce the condition of endocarditis or pericarditis.</p>

<p><b>Cause.</b>‚ÄîUsually exposure to cold‚Äîchilling of the body‚Äîdamp
atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>‚ÄîRest in bed is important. The bedding should be
yielding, and the patient wear loose flannel night-clothes. Sleeping
between blankets promotes perspiration, increases the activity of the
skin, prevents exposure to cold and may reduce the liability to heart
trouble. Change bed-clothing frequently.</p>

<p><i>Diet.</i>‚ÄîShould be easily digested food. Milk is the most
suitable. Dilute with alkaline or mineral water. Barley- or
oatmeal-water and lemonade may be given. Broths and soups may be
substituted for milk at times. Regular feedings every two hours until
patient convalesces.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">GOUT.</h3>

<p>Gout is characterized by sudden attacks of severe pain in the smaller
joints, especially that of the big toe. There is a gradual deposit of
urate of sodium in and about the joints, and presence of uric acid in
the blood.</p>

<p><b>Causes.</b>‚ÄîIntemperate living, excess in drinking wines and
liquors, overindulgence in rich foods, change of climate.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>‚ÄîProper elimination. Free use of all kinds of mineral
waters, abstention from alcoholic drinks and moderation in eating.
Exercise by walking and living in the open air may counteract any
hereditary tendency to the disease. Cold baths, followed by massage,
may be given to the sthenic patient, while the warm and tepid bath
should be substituted for the asthenic type. Protect the body from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
exposure to cold. Flannel underwear should be worn.</p>

<p><i>Diet.</i>‚ÄîMilk for liquid‚Äîno coffee or tea. Vegetables and fruit,
excepting bananas, strawberries, tomatoes, oranges, lemons; fish,
oysters and soup in small quantities; no fresh meat should be allowed
for a time. Avoid hot breads, pastry of all kinds, spices and eggs.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">DIABETES MELLITUS.</h3>

<p>A disorder of nutrition, characterized by an accumulation of sugar in
the blood, and excreted in the urine. The amount of urine is greatly
increased, accompanied by progressive loss of flesh and strength.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>‚ÄîRegulate diet, exercise and mode of living. A warm
bath every other day and a Turkish bath every two weeks are very
beneficial.</p>

<p><i>Diet.</i>‚ÄîAvoid sugar, starch and all liquors. Patient may
eat soups without vegetables and flour; fish of all kinds; meats
and fats cooked in any way except with flour; gluten bread. Of
vegetables‚Äîlettuce, cucumbers, spinach, tomatoes, onions, celery,
radishes, cauliflower, cabbage, egg-plant. Of desserts‚Äîcustard, nuts,
acid fruits, ice cream without sugar. Of drinks‚Äîcoffee, tea and
buttermilk, lemonade, beef-tea, chicken broth, and egg-nog.</p>

<p>Fluid diet must be moderate, and sugar and flour must not be
used in any form.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BRIGHT‚ÄôS DISEASE.</h3>

<p class="center">(Acute Nephritis; Inflammation of the Kidneys.)</p>

<p><b>Due</b> to the action of cold or toxic agents upon the kidneys.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>‚ÄîCold, poisons of specific fevers, toxic agents,
pregnancy, blows and injuries of the back, lesions of the skin as in
burns or in chronic skin diseases.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms.</b>‚ÄîFever, pain in the back over the kidneys, nausea,
vomiting, frequent desire to urinate, puffiness of the face, swelling
of the ankles, extreme pallor of the skin, shortness of the breath,
with the general appearance of complete exhaustion. The urine is very
scanty and highly colored.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p><b>Treatment.</b>‚ÄîRest in bed until all symptoms disappear. To promote
activity of the skin and kidneys, alcohol or steam sweats should be
given daily. To eliminate and purge the bowels give saline cathartics;
and alkaline mineral waters may be used freely.</p>

<p><i>Diet.</i>‚ÄîButtermilk, gruels made of barley or arrowroot, or
oatmeal water; animal broths and oysters; substitute cream-of-tartar
lemonade or plain lemonade for tea or coffee. Pure milk should be taken freely.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">UREMIA.</h3>

<p>Uremia occasionally develops during the course of acute or chronic
Bright‚Äôs disease and other maladies, the result of the retention or
accumulation in the blood of an excrementitious material, supposed to
be urea, the flow of urine being either normal, lessened, or increased.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TREATMENT FOR TUBERCULOSIS.</h3>

<p>Fresh air and sunshine, a rest in bed from one to three months, and
proper food are the three vital points of importance. Do not give too
many baths.</p>

<p><b>Diet</b> should consist of starch foods‚Äî60 per cent. Stale bread
and crackers may be prepared in variety. Give albuminoids and tender
meats. Milk and eggs should be given about six times a day.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">FOR PATIENT IN SITTING POSITION.</h3>

<p>A contrivance easily made and very useful in nursing cases where the
patient is to be kept in the semirecumbent or sitting position, as,
for instance, in pneumonia, or in operations on the upper abdomen, is
arranged by taking a broomstick with the broom part sawed off. Wrap
around this stick a blanket, large pillow, or something to make it
resemble a knee bolster. Place this under the knees of the patient,
and to each end of the broomstick attach a stout cord, which may be
securely tied to the bed-posts at the head of the bed. This will add
to the comfort of the patient in preventing the constant sliding down
which is so difficult to prevent. It will also save the nurse a great
deal of tugging and lifting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MISCELLANEUOS NOTES<br> AND REMEDIES.</h2>
</div>

<h3>COLDS.</h3>

<p>This was one of the subjects of discussion at one of the meetings of
the New York State Medical Association.</p>

<p>One physician thought that cold was only a predisposing factor in
these cases, microbes being the chief element in the affection. At the
beginning of an ordinary cold in the head the serous flow was an effort
of nature to relieve the congestion and eliminate the infection, hence
it should not be interfered with at this stage.</p>

<p>Another doctor said that while cold was a separate disease in the minds
of the laity, to physicians it always meant a condition secondary to
something else. A person with nasal polypi, for example, would complain
of almost constant stuffiness of the nose; one with an enlarged lingual
tonsil became hoarse after very slight use of the voice in singing.</p>

<p>Dr. ‚Äî‚Äî ‚Äî‚Äî ‚Äî‚Äî, of New York, took up the treatment of colds. He
thought some colds in the head are communicable, and that isolation
might sometimes be a useful protective measure. Cod-liver oil was a
good preventive for those who were in the habit of constantly catching
cold. If the temperature was over 100¬∞ F., he insisted on the patient
staying in bed, or at least in the house. A moderate dose of quinin and
Dover‚Äôs powder at night, followed in the morning by a laxative, would
cut short some colds. A hot mustard foot-bath increased the comfort
of the patient. Rhinitis tablets were effectual if taken early, but
persons susceptible to belladonna should be careful in using them. The
alkaline treatment was often satisfactory‚Äîone dram of bicarbonate of
soda in half a glass of water, with a few drops of lemon juice. Camphor
internally and by inhalation often yielded good results. He was not a
great believer in local treatment, though admitting that irrigation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
with saline solution was often useful. It was, however, dangerous
except in skilful hands. When colds showed a tendency to recur, he
advocated tincture chlorid of iron in large doses for two or three
days, also cod-liver oil, quinin, or the vegetable bitters. Sometimes
change of climate was the only cure.</p>

<p><b>Cold a Germ Disease.</b>‚ÄîWalsh, in the <i>Medical News</i>,
says a very striking indication that cold is due to <i>microbic
invasion</i> is to be found in the fact that the process is nearly
always accompanied by <i>fever</i>. A distinct period of incubation can
be traced, and the efficient cause of the illness is commonly farther
off than the patient imagines. The treatment advised when fever and
chilliness occur is the use of calomel and hot drinks, especially
cream-of-tartar lemonade, which acts as a diuretic as well as a
laxative. A diaphoretic at the beginning of the affection will always
give the patient comfort and may unload the system of enough depressed
toxic material to enable it to react and bring about the abortion of a cold.</p>

<p>Other medical men objected to calling everything an infection. A common
cold, they thought, was nothing else than the effect of the lowered
temperature on the human system. The dry air of houses caused a chronic
postnasal catarrh, which at times increased. To overcome susceptibility
to catching cold, overdressing should be avoided and cold baths taken.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TREATMENT OF HYPERIDROSIS.</h3>

<p>In sweating of the feet a single application of diluted formaldehyd
will bring about permanent relief. For the axilla, use 10 drops of
formaldehyd to 2 ounces of water.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TREATMENT OF ERYSIPELAS.</h3>

<p>Apply a thick layer of white vaselin twice a day. Protect with linen
and gauze bandages.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TO DISTINGUISH CHICKEN<br> FROM SMALLPOX.</h3>

<p>If the vesicle in chicken-pox is pricked with a needle, its contents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
can be completely evacuated and the cell will collapse; whereas, in
small-pox the vesicle can be pricked twenty times and it will be
impossible to empty it.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TREATMENT OF FELON.</h3>

<p>A felon <i>may sometimes be</i> aborted by the application of pure
alcohol under exclusion of air. Cover the phalanx with a thin layer
of absorbent cotton saturated with alcohol; over this put on a rubber
finger-stall. In severe cases the tissues should be deeply incised.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TREATMENT OF BOILS.</h3>

<p>Apply hot dressings; incise if necessary. The application of pure
alcohol dressings and a plug of cotton saturated in the same solution
and inserted in the wound promotes rapid healing.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">TO DISLODGE AN INSECT<br> FROM THE EAR.</h3>

<p>Saturate a piece of cotton-wool in salt and vinegar. Fill the ear with
it. Have patient lie on the ear and give firm pressure with the hand.
The insect may be found on the cotton when the plug is taken out. Oil
may be used as a substitute.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a>
Foreign bodies in the ear usually cause far less trouble
and harm than does the attempt to remove them by anyone not expert.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="spa2">RELIEF FOR EARACHE.</h3>

<p>Make a small funnel of paper, and saturate a ball of cotton with
chloroform; drop it into the funnel. Place the funnel in the ear,
draw a long breath and then blow the breath into the large end of the
funnel; the fumes of the chloroform are thus carried into the ear, and
all pain ceases at once. No doubt, heat is the best remedy of all.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">RELIEF FROM FLIES AND MOSQUITOES.</h3>

<p>Pour into an atomizer half a teaspoonful of lavender oil. Add to this
as much alcohol as will make a saturated solution. Use as a spray.
Sweet clover hung about the room will banish flies and mosquitoes. The
drier the clover becomes the more effectual it is.</p>

<h3 class="spa2">BLOOD-CORPUSCLES.</h3>

<p>The average number of red blood-corpuscles per cubic millimeter is
about 5,000,000 for men, and somewhat less for women. The number is
much increased in people who live in altitudes of about 8000 feet or
more. The greatest decrease occurs in anemia, when they may number
less than 1,000,000, and in leukemia, when there may be not more than
2,000,000.</p>

<p>The average number of white blood-corpuscles per cubic millimeter
varies from 5000 to 10,000. The number is usually decreased in anemia,
and much increased in leukemia, when they may number 500,000 per cubic
millimeter.</p>

<p>Blood should contain 100 per cent. hemoglobin. Hospital patients seldom
have this amount. Patients are not considered safe for operation who
have less than 50 per cent., and can not live long if they have 10 per
cent. or less.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
